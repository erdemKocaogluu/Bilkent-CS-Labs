st petersburgh dec

you will rejoice to hear that no disaster have accompany the commencement of an enterprise which you
have regard with such evil foreboding i arrive here yesterday and my first task be to assure my dear
sister of my welfare and increase confidence in the success of my undertaking

i be already far north of london and a i walk in the street of petersburgh i feel a cold northern
breeze play upon my cheek which brace my nerve and fill me with delight do you understand this
feeling this breeze which have travel from the region towards which i be advance give me a foretaste
of those icy clime inspirit by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try
in vain to be persuade that the pole be the seat of frost and desolation it ever present itself to
my imagination a the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun be for ever visible it
broad disk just skirt the horizon and diffuse a perpetual splendour there for with your leave my
sister i will put some trust in precede navigator there snow and frost be banish and sail over a
calm sea we may be waft to a land surpass in wonder and in beauty every region hitherto discover on
the habitable globe it production and feature may be without example a the phenomenon of the
heavenly body undoubtedly be in those undiscovered solitude what may not be expect in a country of
eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attract the needle and may regulate a
thousand celestial observation that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricity
consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never
before visited and may tread a land never before imprint by the foot of man these be my enticement
and they be sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feel when he embark in a little boat with his holiday mat on
an expedition of discovery up his native river but suppose all these conjecture to be false you can
not contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by
discover a passage near the pole to those country to reach which at present so many month be
requisite or by ascertain the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effect by an
undertaking such a mine

these reflection have dispel the agitation with which i begin my letter and i feel my heart glow
with an enthusiasm which elevate me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the
mind a a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix it intellectual eye this expedition have
be the favourite dream of my early year i have read with ardour the account of the various voyage
which have be make in the prospect of arrive at the north pacific ocean through the sea which
surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyage make for purpose of discovery
compose the whole of our good uncle thomas library my education be neglect yet i be passionately
fond of read these volume be my study day and night and my familiarity with them increase that
regret which i have felt a a child on learn that my father die injunction have forbidden my uncle to
allow me to embark in a seafaring life

these vision fade when i peruse for the first time those poet whose effusion entrance my soul and
lift it to heaven i also become a poet and for one year live in a paradise of my own creation i
imagine that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the name of homer and shakespeare be
consecrate you be well acquaint with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just
at that time i inherit the fortune of my cousin and my thought be turn into the channel of their
early bent

six year have pass since i resolve on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from
which i dedicate myself to this great enterprise i commence by inure my body to hardship i accompany
the whale fisher on several expedition to the north sea i voluntarily endure cold famine thirst and
want of sleep i often work hard than the common sailor during the day and devote my night to the
study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branch of physical science from which a naval
adventurer might derive the great practical advantage twice i actually hire myself a an under mate
in a greenland whaler and acquit myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my
captain offer me the second dignity in the vessel and entreat me to remain with the great
earnestness so valuable do he consider my service

and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose my life might have be pass
in ease and luxury but i prefer glory to every enticement that wealth place in my path oh that some
encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution be firm but my hope
fluctuate and my spirit be often depressed i be about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the
emergency of which will demand all my fortitude i be require not only to raise the spirit of others
but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs be fail

this be the most favourable period for travel in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their
sledge the motion be pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english
stagecoach the cold be not excessive if you be wrap in fur a dress which i have already adopt for
there be a great difference between walk the deck and remain seated motionless for hour when no
exercise prevent the blood from actually freeze in your vein i have no ambition to lose my life on
the post road between st petersburgh and archangel

i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three week and my intention be to hire a ship
there which can easily be do by pay the insurance for the owner and to engage a many sailor a i
think necessary among those who be accustom to the whale fishing i do not intend to sail until the
month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed
many many month perhaps year will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again
soon or never

farewell my dear excellent margaret heaven shower down blessing on you and save me that i may again
and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness

your affectionate brother

archangel march

how slowly the time pass here encompass a i be by frost and snow yet a second step be take towards
my enterprise i have hire a vessel and be occupy in collect my sailor those whom i have already
engage appear to be men on whom i can depend and be certainly possess of dauntless courage

but i have one want which i have never yet be able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which
i now feel a a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i be glow with the enthusiasm of
success there will be none to participate my joy if i be assail by disappointment no one will
endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thought to paper it be true but that be a
poor medium for the communication of feel i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me
whose eye would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want
of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possess of a cultivate as well a of a
capacious mind whose taste be like my own to approve or amend my plan how would such a friend repair
the fault of your poor brother i be too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulty but it
be a still great evil to me that i be self educate for the first fourteen year of my life i run wild
on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas book of voyage at that age i become acquaint with
the celebrated poet of our own country but it be only when it have cease to be in my power to derive
it most important benefit from such a conviction that i perceive the necessity of become acquaint
with more language than that of my native country now i be twenty eight and be in reality more
illiterate than many schoolboy of fifteen it be true that i have think more and that my daydream be
more extended and magnificent but they want a the painter call it keep and i greatly need a friend
who would have sense enough not to despise me a romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to
regulate my mind

well these be useless complaint i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in
archangel among merchant and seaman yet some feeling unallied to the dross of human nature beat even
in these rugged bosom my lieutenant for instance be a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he be
madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his
profession he be an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudice unsoftened by
cultivation retain some of the noble endowment of humanity i first become acquaint with him on board
a whale vessel find that he be unemployed in this city i easily engage him to assist in my
enterprise

the master be a person of an excellent disposition and be remarkable in the ship for his gentleness
and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance add to his well know integrity and dauntless
courage make me very desirous to engage him a youth pass in solitude my best year spend under your
gentle and feminine fosterage have so refine the groundwork of my character that i can not overcome
an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercise on board ship i have never believe it to be
necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally note for his kindliness of heart and the respect and
obedience pay to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in be able to secure his service
i hear of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owe to him the happiness of her life
this briefly be his story some year ago he love a young russian lady of moderate fortune and have
amass a considerable sum in prize money the father of the girl consent to the match he saw his
mistress once before the destined ceremony but she be bath in tear and throw herself at his foot
entreat him to spare her confessing at the same time that she love another but that he be poor and
that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassure the suppliant and on be
inform of the name of her lover instantly abandon his pursuit he have already buy a farm with his
money on which he have design to pass the remainder of his life but he bestow the whole on his rival
together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock and then himself solicit the young
woman father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refuse think
himself bound in honour to my friend who when he find the father inexorable quit his country nor
return until he hear that his former mistress be marry accord to her inclination what a noble fellow
you will exclaim he be so but then he be wholly uneducated he be as silent a a turk and a kind of
ignorant carelessness attend him which while it render his conduct the more astonishing detracts
from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command

yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toil
which i may never know that i be waver in my resolution those be as fix a fate and my voyage be only
now delay until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter have be dreadfully severe but the
spring promise well and it be consider a a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner
than i expect i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and
considerateness whenever the safety of others be commit to my care

i can not describe to you my sensation on the near prospect of my undertaking it be impossible to
communicate to you a conception of the tremble sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with
which i be prepare to depart i be go to unexplored region to the land of mist and snow but i shall
kill no albatross therefore do not be alarm for my safety or if i should come back to you a worn and
woeful a the ancient mariner you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often
attribute my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mystery of ocean to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poet there be something at work in my soul which i do
not understand i be practically industrious painstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and
labour but besides this there be a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwine in
all my project which hurry me out of the common pathway of men even to the wild sea and unvisited
region i be about to explore

but to return to dearer consideration shall i meet you again after have traverse immense sea and
return by the most southern cape of africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i can not
bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every
opportunity i may receive your letter on some occasion when i need them most to support my spirit i
love you very tenderly remember me with affection should you never hear from me again

your affectionate brother robert walton

reach england by a merchantman now on it homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who
may not see my native land perhaps for many year i be however in good spirit my men be bold and
apparently firm of purpose nor do the float sheet of ice that continually pass u indicate the danger
of the region towards which we be advance appear to dismay them we have already reach a very high
latitude but it be the height of summer and although not so warm a in england the southern gale
which blow u speedily towards those shore which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of
renovate warmth which i have not expect

no incident have hitherto befall u that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gale and
the springing of a leak be accident which experience navigator scarcely remember to record and i
shall be well content if nothing worse happen to u during our voyage

adieu my dear margaret be assure that for my own sake as well a yours i will not rashly encounter
danger i will be cool persevering and prudent

but success shall crown my endeavour wherefore not thus far i have go trace a secure way over the
pathless seas the very star themselves be witness and testimony of my triumph why not still proceed
over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolve will of man

my swell heart involuntarily pour itself out thus but i must finish heaven bless my beloved sister

letter

to mrs saville england

august

so strange an accident have happen to u that i can not forbear record it although it be very
probable that you will see me before these paper can come into your possession

last monday july we be nearly surround by ice which close in the ship on all side scarcely leave her
the sea room in which she float our situation be somewhat dangerous especially a we be compass round
by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hop that some change would take place in the atmosphere
and weather

about two oclock the mist clear away and we behold stretch out in every direction vast and irregular
plain of ice which seem to have no end some of my comrade groan and my own mind begin to grow
watchful with anxious thought when a strange sight suddenly attract our attention and divert our
solicitude from our own situation we perceive a low carriage fix on a sledge and draw by dog pas on
towards the north at the distance of half a mile a be which have the shape of a man but apparently
of gigantic stature sit in the sledge and guide the dog we watch the rapid progress of the traveller
with our telescope until he be lose among the distant inequality of the ice

this appearance excite our unqualified wonder we be a we believe many hundred mile from any land but
this apparition seem to denote that it be not in reality so distant a we have suppose shut in
however by ice it be impossible to follow his track which we have observe with the great attention

about two hour after this occurrence we hear the ground sea and before night the ice break and free
our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose mass
which float about after the break up of the ice i profit of this time to rest for a few hour

in the morning however as soon a it be light i go upon deck and find all the sailor busy on one side
of the vessel apparently talk to someone in the sea it be in fact a sledge like that we have see
before which have drift towards u in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remain alive
but there be a human be within it whom the sailor be persuade to enter the vessel he be not a the
other traveller seem to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i
appear on deck the master say here be our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open
sea

on perceive me the stranger address me in english although with a foreign accent before i come on
board your vessel say he will you have the kindness to inform me whither you be bind

you may conceive my astonishment on hear such a question address to me from a man on the brink of
destruction and to whom i should have suppose that my vessel would have be a resource which he would
not have exchange for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i reply however that we be on a
voyage of discovery towards the northern pole

upon hear this he appear satisfied and consent to come on board good god margaret if you have see
the man who thus capitulate for his safety your surprise would have be boundless his limb be nearly
frozen and his body dreadfully emaciate by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a
condition we attempt to carry him into the cabin but as soon a he have quit the fresh air he faint
we accordingly bring him back to the deck and restore him to animation by rub him with brandy and
force him to swallow a small quantity as soon a he show sign of life we wrap him up in blanket and
place him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degree he recover and eat a little soup
which restore him wonderfully

two day pass in this manner before he be able to speak and i often fear that his suffering have
deprive him of understand when he have in some measure recover i remove him to my own cabin and
attend on him as much a my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature his eye have
generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there be moment when if anyone perform an
act of kindness towards him or do him any the most trifling service his whole countenance be light
up a it be with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equal but he be generally
melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnash his teeth a if impatient of the weight of woe that
oppress him

when my guest be a little recovered i have great trouble to keep off the men who wish to ask him a
thousand question but i would not allow him to be torment by their idle curiosity in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depend upon entire repose once however the lieutenant ask why
he have come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle

his countenance instantly assume an aspect of the deep gloom and he reply to seek one who flee from
me

and do the man whom you pursue travel in the same fashion

yes

then i fancy we have see him for the day before we pick you up we saw some dog draw a sledge with a
man in it across the ice

this arouse the stranger attention and he ask a multitude of question concern the route which the
dmon a he call him have pursue soon after when he be alone with me he say i have doubtless excite
your curiosity as well a that of these good people but you be too considerate to make inquiry

certainly it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
inquisitiveness of mine

and yet you rescue me from a strange and perilous situation you have benevolently restore me to life

soon after this he inquire if i think that the break up of the ice have destroy the other sledge i
reply that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice have not break until near
midnight and the traveller might have arrive at a place of safety before that time but of this i
could not judge

from this time a new spirit of life animate the decaying frame of the stranger he manifest the great
eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which have before appear but i have persuade him
to remain in the cabin for he be far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have
promise that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should
appear in sight

such be my journal of what relate to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger have
gradually improve in health but be very silent and appear uneasy when anyone except myself enter his
cabin yet his manner be so conciliating and gentle that the sailor be all interested in him although
they have have very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him a a brother
and his constant and deep grief fill me with sympathy and compassion he must have be a noble
creature in his better day be even now in wreck so attractive and amiable

i say in one of my letter my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean yet i have
find a man who before his spirit have be break by misery i should have be happy to have possess a
the brother of my heart

i shall continue my journal concern the stranger at interval should i have any fresh incident to
record

august

my affection for my guest increase every day he excite at once my admiration and my pity to an
astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroy by misery without feel the most
poignant grief he be so gentle yet so wise his mind be so cultivated and when he speak although his
word be cull with the choice art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence

he be now much recover from his illness and be continually on the deck apparently watch for the
sledge that precede his own yet although unhappy he be not so utterly occupy by his own misery but
that he interest himself deeply in the project of others he have frequently converse with me on mine
which i have communicate to him without disguise he enter attentively into all my argument in favour
of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measure i have take to secure it i be
easily lead by the sympathy which he evince to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the
burn ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warm me how gladly i would sacrifice my
fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one man life or death be but
a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i seek for the dominion i should
acquire and transmit over the elemental foe of our race a i speak a dark gloom spread over my
listener countenance at first i perceive that he try to suppress his emotion he place his hand
before his eye and my voice quiver and fail me a i behold tear trickle fast from between his finger
a groan burst from his heave breast i pause at length he speak in broken accent unhappy man do you
share my madness have you drink also of the intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale and
you will dash the cup from your lip

such word you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that have seize
the stranger overcome his weakened power and many hour of repose and tranquil conversation be
necessary to restore his composure

have conquer the violence of his feeling he appear to despise himself for be the slave of passion
and quell the dark tyranny of despair he lead me again to converse concern myself personally he ask
me the history of my early year the tale be quickly tell but it awaken various train of reflection i
spoke of my desire of find a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind
than have ever fall to my lot and express my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness
who do not enjoy this blessing

i agree with you reply the stranger we be unfashioned creature but half make up if one wiser well
dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and
faulty nature i once have a friend the most noble of human creature and be entitle therefore to
judge respect friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but i
i have lose everything and can not begin life anew

a he say this his countenance become expressive of a calm settle grief that touch me to the heart
but he be silent and presently retire to his cabin

even break in spirit a he be no one can feel more deeply than he do the beauty of nature the starry
sky the sea and every sight afford by these wonderful region seem still to have the power of elevate
his soul from earth such a man have a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelm by
disappointment yet when he have retire into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that have a
halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly venture

will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concern this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him
you have be tutor and refine by book and retirement from the world and you be therefore somewhat
fastidious but this only render you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merit of this
wonderful man sometimes i have endeavour to discover what quality it be which he possess that
elevate him so immeasurably above any other person i ever know i believe it to be an intuitive
discernment a quick but never fail power of judgment a penetration into the cause of thing
unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied
intonation be soul subdue music

august

yesterday the stranger say to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffer great and
unparalleled misfortune i have determine at one time that the memory of these evil should die with
me but you have win me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom a i once do and i
ardently hope that the gratification of your wish may not be a serpent to sting you a mine have be i
do not know that the relation of my disaster will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you be
pursue the same course expose yourself to the same danger which have render me what i be i imagine
that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your
undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrence which be usually deem
marvellous be we among the tame scene of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your
ridicule but many thing will appear possible in these wild and mysterious region which would provoke
the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever varied power of nature nor can i doubt but that my
tale conveys in it series internal evidence of the truth of the event of which it be compose

you may easily imagine that i be much gratify by the offer communication yet i could not endure that
he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortune i felt the great eagerness to hear the
promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if
it be in my power i express these feeling in my answer

i thank you he reply for your sympathy but it be useless my fate be nearly fulfil i wait but for one
event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continue he perceive that i wish to
interrupt him but you be mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter
my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it be determined

he then tell me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this
promise drew from me the warm thanks i have resolve every night when i be not imperatively occupy by
my duty to record as nearly a possible in his own word what he have relate during the day if i
should be engage i will at least make note this manuscript will doubtless afford you the great
pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lip with what interest and sympathy
shall i read it in some future day even now a i commence my task his full toned voice swell in my
ear his lustrous eye dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raise in
animation while the lineament of his face be irradiate by the soul within strange and harrowing must
be his story frightful the storm which embrace the gallant vessel on it course and wreck it thus

chapter

i be by birth a genevese and my family be one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestor
have be for many year counsellor and syndic and my father have fill several public situation with
honour and reputation he be respect by all who know him for his integrity and indefatigable
attention to public business he pass his younger day perpetually occupy by the affair of his country
a variety of circumstance have prevent his marry early nor be it until the decline of life that he
become a husband and the father of a family

a the circumstance of his marriage illustrate his character i can not refrain from relate them one
of his most intimate friend be a merchant who from a flourish state fell through numerous mischance
into poverty this man whose name be beaufort be of a proud and unbending disposition and could not
bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he have formerly be distinguish for
his rank and magnificence have pay his debt therefore in the most honourable manner he retreat with
his daughter to the town of lucerne where he live unknown and in wretchedness my father love
beaufort with the truest friendship and be deeply grieve by his retreat in these unfortunate
circumstance he bitterly deplore the false pride which lead his friend to a conduct so little worthy
of the affection that unite them he lose no time in endeavour to seek him out with the hope of
persuade him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance

beaufort have take effectual measure to conceal himself and it be ten month before my father
discover his abode overjoy at this discovery he hasten to the house which be situate in a mean
street near the reuss but when he enter misery and despair alone welcome him beaufort have save but
a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortune but it be sufficient to provide him with
sustenance for some month and in the meantime he hop to procure some respectable employment in a
merchant house the interval be consequently spend in inaction his grief only become more deep and
rankle when he have leisure for reflection and at length it take so fast hold of his mind that at
the end of three month he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion

his daughter attend him with the great tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund be
rapidly decrease and that there be no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possess a mind
of an uncommon mould and her courage rise to support her in her adversity she procure plain work she
plait straw and by various mean contrive to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life

several month pass in this manner her father grow bad her time be more entirely occupy in attend him
her mean of subsistence decrease and in the tenth month her father die in her arm leave her an
orphan and a beggar this last blow overcome her and she kneel by beauforts coffin weep bitterly when
my father enter the chamber he come like a protect spirit to the poor girl who commit herself to his
care and after the interment of his friend he conduct her to geneva and place her under the
protection of a relation two year after this event caroline become his wife

there be a considerable difference between the age of my parent but this circumstance seem to unite
them only closer in bond of devoted affection there be a sense of justice in my father upright mind
which render it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former year
he have suffer from the late discover unworthiness of one beloved and so be dispose to set a great
value on tried worth there be a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differ
wholly from the dot fondness of age for it be inspire by reverence for her virtue and a desire to be
the mean of in some degree recompense her for the sorrow she have endure but which give
inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything be make to yield to her wish and her
convenience he strive to shelter her a a fair exotic be shelter by the gardener from every rougher
wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit have be shake
by what she have go through during the two year that have elapse previous to their marriage my
father have gradually relinquish all his public function and immediately after their union they seek
the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that
land of wonder a a restorative for her weakened frame

from italy they visit germany and france i their eldest child be bear at naples and a an infant
accompany them in their ramble i remain for several year their only child much a they be attach to
each other they seem to draw inexhaustible store of affection from a very mine of love to bestow
them upon me my mother tender caress and my father smile of benevolent pleasure while regard me be
my first recollection i be their plaything and their idol and something well their child the
innocent and helpless creature bestow on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future
lot it be in their hand to direct to happiness or misery accord a they fulfil their duty towards me
with this deep consciousness of what they owe towards the be to which they have give life add to the
active spirit of tenderness that animate both it may be imagine that while during every hour of my
infant life i receive a lesson of patience of charity and of self control i be so guide by a silken
cord that all seem but one train of enjoyment to me

for a long time i be their only care my mother have much desire to have a daughter but i continue
their single offspring when i be about five year old while make an excursion beyond the frontier of
italy they pass a week on the shore of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often make them
enter the cottage of the poor this to my mother be more than a duty it be a necessity a passion
remember what she have suffer and how she have be relieve for her to act in her turn the guardian
angel to the afflict during one of their walk a poor cot in the folding of a vale attract their
notice a be singularly disconsolate while the number of half clothe child gather about it speak of
penury in it bad shape one day when my father have go by himself to milan my mother accompany by me
visit this abode she find a peasant and his wife hard work bent down by care and labour distribute a
scanty meal to five hungry babe among these there be one which attract my mother far above all the
rest she appear of a different stock the four others be dark eyed hardy little vagrant this child be
thin and very fair her hair be the bright living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seem
to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow be clear and ample her blue eye cloudless and her
lip and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without look on her a of a distinct species a be heaven sent and bear a celestial stamp in all
her feature

the peasant woman perceive that my mother fixed eye of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl
eagerly communicate her history she be not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her
mother be a german and have die on give her birth the infant have be place with these good people to
nurse they be good off then they have not be long married and their eldest child be but just bear
the father of their charge be one of those italian nurse in the memory of the antique glory of italy
one among the schiavi ognor frementi who exert himself to obtain the liberty of his country he
become the victim of it weakness whether he have die or still linger in the dungeon of austria be
not know his property be confiscate his child become an orphan and a beggar she continue with her
foster parent and bloom in their rude abode fair than a garden rise among dark leave bramble

when my father return from milan he find play with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than
picture cherub a creature who seem to shed radiance from her look and whose form and motion be light
than the chamois of the hill the apparition be soon explain with his permission my mother prevail on
her rustic guardian to yield their charge to her they be fond of the sweet orphan her presence have
seem a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when
providence afford her such powerful protection they consult their village priest and the result be
that elizabeth lavenza become the inmate of my parent house my more than sister the beautiful and
adored companion of all my occupation and my pleasure

everyone love elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regard her
become while i share it my pride and my delight on the even previous to her be bring to my home my
mother have say playfully i have a pretty present for my victor tomorrow he shall have it and when
on the morrow she present elizabeth to me a her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpret
her word literally and look upon elizabeth a mine mine to protect love and cherish all praise bestow
on her i receive a make to a possession of my own we call each other familiarly by the name of
cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stand to me my more
than sister since till death she be to be mine only

chapter

we be bring up together there be not quite a year difference in our age i need not say that we be
stranger to any specie of disunion or dispute harmony be the soul of our companionship and the
diversity and contrast that subsist in our character draw u nearer together elizabeth be of a calmer
and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i be capable of a more intense application
and be more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busy herself with follow the aerial
creation of the poet and in the majestic and wondrous scene which surround our swiss home the
sublime shape of the mountain the change of the season tempest and calm the silence of winter and
the life and turbulence of our alpine summer she find ample scope for admiration and delight while
my companion contemplate with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearance of thing i
delight in investigate their cause the world be to me a secret which i desire to divine curiosity
earnest research to learn the hidden law of nature gladness akin to rapture a they be unfold to me
be among the early sensation i can remember

on the birth of a second son my junior by seven year my parent give up entirely their wandering life
and fix themselves in their native country we possess a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive
the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we reside
principally in the latter and the life of my parent be pass in considerable seclusion it be my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i be indifferent therefore to my
school fellow in general but i unite myself in the bond of the close friendship to one among them
henry clerval be the son of a merchant of geneva he be a boy of singular talent and fancy he love
enterprise hardship and even danger for it own sake he be deeply read in book of chivalry and
romance he compose heroic song and begin to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure
he try to make u act play and to enter into masquerade in which the character be draw from the hero
of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to
redeem the holy sepulchre from the hand of the infidel

no human be could have pass a happy childhood than myself my parent be possess by the very spirit of
kindness and indulgence we felt that they be not the tyrant to rule our lot accord to their caprice
but the agent and creator of all the many delight which we enjoy when i mingle with other family i
distinctly discern how peculiarly fortunate my lot be and gratitude assist the development of filial
love

my temper be sometimes violent and my passion vehement but by some law in my temperature they be
turn not towards childish pursuit but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all thing
indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of language nor the code of government nor the
politics of various state possess attraction for me it be the secret of heaven and earth that i
desire to learn and whether it be the outward substance of thing or the inner spirit of nature and
the mysterious soul of man that occupy me still my inquiry be direct to the metaphysical or in it
high sense the physical secret of the world

meanwhile clerval occupy himself so to speak with the moral relation of thing the busy stage of life
the virtue of hero and the action of men be his theme and his hope and his dream be to become one
among those whose name be record in story a the gallant and adventurous benefactor of our specie the
saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicate lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy be
ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eye be ever there to bless and
animate u she be the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my
study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she be there to subdue me to a semblance of her
own gentleness and clerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not
have be so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness
amidst his passion for adventurous exploit have she not unfold to him the real loveliness of
beneficence and make the do good the end and aim of his soar ambition

i feel exquisite pleasure in dwell on the recollection of childhood before misfortune have taint my
mind and change it bright vision of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflection upon self
besides in draw the picture of my early day i also record those event which lead by insensible step
to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which
afterwards rule my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten
source but swell a it proceed it become the torrent which in it course have sweep away all my hope
and joy

natural philosophy be the genius that have regulate my fate i desire therefore in this narration to
state those fact which lead to my predilection for that science when i be thirteen year of age we
all go on a party of pleasure to the bath near thonon the inclemency of the weather oblige u to
remain a day confine to the inn in this house i chance to find a volume of the work of cornelius
agrippa i open it with apathy the theory which he attempt to demonstrate and the wonderful fact
which he relate soon change this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seem to dawn upon my mind and
bound with joy i communicate my discovery to my father my father look carelessly at the title page
of my book and say ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it be sad
trash

if instead of this remark my father have take the pain to explain to me that the principle of
agrippa have be entirely explode and that a modern system of science have be introduce which possess
much great power than the ancient because the power of the latter be chimerical while those of the
former be real and practical under such circumstance i should certainly have throw agrippa aside and
have content my imagination warm a it be by return with great ardour to my former study it be even
possible that the train of my idea would never have receive the fatal impulse that lead to my ruin
but the cursory glance my father have take of my volume by no mean assure me that he be acquaint
with it content and i continue to read with the great avidity

when i return home my first care be to procure the whole work of this author and afterwards of
paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and study the wild fancy of these writer with delight they
appear to me treasure know to few besides myself i have describe myself a always have be imbue with
a fervent longing to penetrate the secret of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful
discovery of modern philosopher i always come from my study discontent and unsatisfied sir isaac
newton be say to have avow that he felt like a child pick up shell beside the great and unexplored
ocean of truth those of his successor in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i be acquaint
appear even to my boys apprehension a tiro engage in the same pursuit

the untaught peasant behold the element around him and be acquaint with their practical use the most
learned philosopher know little more he have partially unveil the face of nature but her immortal
lineament be still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give name but not to speak
of a final cause cause in their secondary and tertiary grade be utterly unknown to him i have gaze
upon the fortification and impediment that seem to keep human being from enter the citadel of nature
and rashly and ignorantly i have repine

but here be book and here be men who have penetrate deeper and know more i take their word for all
that they aver and i become their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the
eighteenth century but while i follow the routine of education in the school of geneva i be to a
great degree self taught with regard to my favourite study my father be not scientific and i be
leave to struggle with a child blindness add to a student thirst for knowledge under the guidance of
my new preceptor i enter with the great diligence into the search of the philosopher stone and the
elixir of life but the latter soon obtain my undivided attention wealth be an inferior object but
what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man
invulnerable to any but a violent death

nor be these my only vision the raising of ghost or devil be a promise liberally accord by my
favourite author the fulfilment of which i most eagerly seek and if my incantation be always
unsuccessful i attribute the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of
skill or fidelity in my instructor and thus for a time i be occupy by exploded system mingle like an
unadept a thousand contradictory theory and flounder desperately in a very slough of multifarious
knowledge guide by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again change the
current of my idea

when i be about fifteen year old we have retire to our house near belrive when we witness a most
violent and terrible thunderstorm it advance from behind the mountain of jura and the thunder burst
at once with frightful loudness from various quarter of the heaven i remain while the storm last
watch it progress with curiosity and delight a i stand at the door on a sudden i behold a stream of
fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stand about twenty yard from our house and so soon a
the dazzling light vanish the oak have disappear and nothing remain but a blasted stump when we
visit it the next morning we find the tree shatter in a singular manner it be not splinter by the
shock but entirely reduce to thin ribbon of wood i never behold anything so utterly destroy

before this i be not unacquainted with the more obvious law of electricity on this occasion a man of
great research in natural philosophy be with u and excite by this catastrophe he enter on the
explanation of a theory which he have form on the subject of electricity and galvanism which be at
once new and astonish to me all that he say threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus
magnus and paracelsus the lord of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men
disincline me to pursue my accustomed study it seem to me a if nothing would or could ever be know
all that have so long engaged my attention suddenly grow despicable by one of those caprice of the
mind which we be perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once give up my former occupation set
down natural history and all it progeny a a deformed and abortive creation and entertain the great
disdain for a would be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in
this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branch of study appertain to that
science a be build upon secure foundation and so worthy of my consideration

thus strangely be our soul construct and by such slight ligament be we bound to prosperity or ruin
when i look back it seem to me a if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will be the
immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort make by the spirit of
preservation to avert the storm that be even then hang in the star and ready to envelop me her
victory be announce by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which follow the relinquishing
of my ancient and latterly torment study it be thus that i be to be teach to associate evil with
their prosecution happiness with their disregard

it be a strong effort of the spirit of good but it be ineffectual destiny be too potent and her
immutable law have decree my utter and terrible destruction

chapter

when i have attain the age of seventeen my parent resolve that i should become a student at the
university of ingolstadt i have hitherto attend the school of geneva but my father think it
necessary for the completion of my education that i should be make acquaint with other custom than
those of my native country my departure be therefore fix at an early date but before the day resolve
upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occur an omen a it be of my future misery

elizabeth have catch the scarlet fever her illness be severe and she be in the great danger during
her illness many argument have be urge to persuade my mother to refrain from attend upon her she
have at first yield to our entreaty but when she hear that the life of her favourite be menace she
could no longer control her anxiety she attend her sickbed her watchful attention triumph over the
malignity of the distemper elizabeth be save but the consequence of this imprudence be fatal to her
preserver on the third day my mother sicken her fever be accompany by the most alarming symptom and
the look of her medical attendant prognosticate the bad event on her deathbed the fortitude and
benignity of this best of woman do not desert her she join the hand of elizabeth and myself my child
she say my firm hope of future happiness be place on the prospect of your union this expectation
will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my young
child alas i regret that i be take from you and happy and beloved a i have be be it not hard to quit
you all but these be not thought befit me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and
will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world

she die calmly and her countenance express affection even in death i need not describe the feeling
of those whose dear tie be rent by that most irreparable evil the void that present itself to the
soul and the despair that be exhibit on the countenance it be so long before the mind can persuade
itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appear a part of our own can have
depart for ever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have be extinguish and the sound of a voice
so familiar and dear to the ear can be hush never more to be hear these be the reflection of the
first day but when the lapse of time prove the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of
grief commences yet from whom have not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should
i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief be
rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that play upon the lip although it may be deem a
sacrilege be not banish my mother be dead but we have still duty which we ought to perform we must
continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remain whom the
spoiler have not seize

my departure for ingolstadt which have be defer by these event be now again determine upon i obtain
from my father a respite of some week it appear to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to
death of the house of mourn and to rush into the thick of life i be new to sorrow but it do not the
less alarm me i be unwilling to quit the sight of those that remain to me and above all i desire to
see my sweet elizabeth in some degree console

she indeed veil her grief and strive to act the comforter to u all she look steadily on life and
assume it duty with courage and zeal she devote herself to those whom she have be teach to call her
uncle and cousin never be she so enchant a at this time when she recall the sunshine of her smile
and spend them upon u she forget even her own regret in her endeavour to make u forget

the day of my departure at length arrive clerval spend the last evening with u he have endeavour to
persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his
father be a narrow mind trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspiration and ambition of his son
henry deeply felt the misfortune of be debar from a liberal education he say little but when he
speak i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrain but firm resolve not to be
chain to the miserable detail of commerce

we sit late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word
farewell it be say and we retire under the pretence of seek repose each fancying that the other be
deceive but when at morning dawn i descend to the carriage which be to convey me away they be all
there my father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her
entreaty that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attention on her playmate and
friend

i throw myself into the chaise that be to convey me away and indulge in the most melancholy
reflection i who have ever be surround by amiable companion continually engage in endeavour to
bestow mutual pleasure i be now alone in the university whither i be go i must form my own friend
and be my own protector my life have hitherto be remarkably seclude and domestic and this have give
me invincible repugnance to new countenance i love my brother elizabeth and clerval these be old
familiar face but i believe myself totally unfit for the company of stranger such be my reflection a
i commence my journey but a i proceed my spirit and hope rise i ardently desire the acquisition of
knowledge i have often when at home think it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place
and have long to enter the world and take my station among other human being now my desire be comply
with and it would indeed have be folly to repent

i have sufficient leisure for these and many other reflection during my journey to ingolstadt which
be long and fatigue at length the high white steeple of the town meet my eye i alight and be conduct
to my solitary apartment to spend the evening a i please

the next morning i deliver my letter of introduction and pay a visit to some of the principal
professor chance or rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which assert omnipotent sway
over me from the moment i turn my reluctant step from my father door lead me first to m krempe
professor of natural philosophy he be an uncouth man but deeply imbue in the secret of his science
he ask me several question concern my progress in the different branch of science appertain to
natural philosophy i reply carelessly and partly in contempt mention the name of my alchemist a the
principal author i have study the professor star have you he say really spend your time in study
such nonsense

i reply in the affirmative every minute continue m krempe with warmth every instant that you have
waste on those book be utterly and entirely lose you have burden your memory with exploded system
and useless names good god in what desert land have you live where no one be kind enough to inform
you that these fancy which you have so greedily imbibe be a thousand year old and as musty a they be
ancient i little expect in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus
and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your study entirely anew

so say he step aside and write down a list of several book treat of natural philosophy which he
desire me to procure and dismiss me after mention that in the beginning of the following week he
intend to commence a course of lecture upon natural philosophy in it general relation and that m
waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate day that he omit

i return home not disappointed for i have say that i have long consider those author useless whom
the professor reprobate but i return not at all the more inclined to recur to these study in any
shape m krempe be a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher
therefore do not prepossess me in favour of his pursuit in rather a too philosophical and connect a
strain perhaps i have give an account of the conclusion i have come to concern them in my early year
a a child i have not be content with the result promise by the modern professor of natural science
with a confusion of idea only to be account for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such
matter i have retrod the step of knowledge along the path of time and exchange the discovery of
recent inquirer for the dream of forgotten alchemist besides i have a contempt for the us of modern
natural philosophy it be very different when the master of the science seek immortality and power
such view although futile be grand but now the scene be change the ambition of the inquirer seem to
limit itself to the annihilation of those vision on which my interest in science be chiefly found i
be require to exchange chimera of boundless grandeur for reality of little worth

such be my reflection during the first two or three day of my residence at ingolstadt which be
chiefly spent in become acquaint with the locality and the principal resident in my new abode but a
the ensue week commence i thought of the information which m krempe have give me concern the lecture
and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentence out of
a pulpit i recollect what he have say of m waldman whom i have never see a he have hitherto be out
of town

partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i go into the lecturing room which m waldman enter
shortly after this professor be very unlike his colleague he appear about fifty year of age but with
an aspect expressive of the great benevolence a few grey hair cover his temple but those at the back
of his head be nearly black his person be short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweet i have
ever hear he begin his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various
improvement make by different men of learn pronounce with fervour the name of the most distinguished
discoverer he then take a cursory view of the present state of the science and explain many of it
elementary term after have make a few preparatory experiment he conclude with a panegyric upon
modern chemistry the term of which i shall never forget

the ancient teacher of this science say he promise impossibility and perform nothing the modern
master promise very little they know that metal can not be transmute and that the elixir of life be
a chimera but these philosopher whose hand seem only make to dabble in dirt and their eye to pore
over the microscope or crucible have indeed perform miracle they penetrate into the recess of nature
and show how she work in her hiding place they ascend into the heaven they have discover how the
blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquire new and almost unlimited
power they can command the thunder of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world
with it own shadow

such be the professor word rather let me say such the word of the fate enounce to destroy me a he go
on i felt a if my soul be grapple with a palpable enemy one by one the various key be touch which
form the mechanism of my be chord after chord be sound and soon my mind be fill with one thought one
conception one purpose so much have be do exclaim the soul of frankenstein more far more will i
achieve tread in the step already mark i will pioneer a new way explore unknown power and unfold to
the world the deep mystery of creation

i close not my eye that night my internal be be in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that
order would thence arise but i have no power to produce it by degree after the morning dawn sleep
come i awoke and my yesternights thought be a a dream there only remain a resolution to return to my
ancient study and to devote myself to a science for which i believe myself to possess a natural
talent on the same day i pay m waldman a visit his manner in private be even more mild and
attractive than in public for there be a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his
own house be replace by the great affability and kindness i give him pretty nearly the same account
of my former pursuit a i have give to his fellow professor he hear with attention the little
narration concern my study and smile at the name of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the
contempt that m krempe have exhibit he say that these be men to whose indefatigable zeal modern
philosopher be indebted for most of the foundation of their knowledge they have leave to u a an easy
task to give new name and arrange in connected classification the fact which they in a great degree
have be the instrument of bring to light the labour of men of genius however erroneously direct
scarcely ever fail in ultimately turn to the solid advantage of mankind i listen to his statement
which be deliver without any presumption or affectation and then add that his lecture have remove my
prejudice against modern chemist i express myself in measure term with the modesty and deference due
from a youth to his instructor without let escape inexperience in life would have make me ashamed
any of the enthusiasm which stimulate my intended labour i request his advice concern the book i
ought to procure

i be happy say m waldman to have gain a disciple and if your application equal your ability i have
no doubt of your success chemistry be that branch of natural philosophy in which the great
improvement have be and may be make it be on that account that i have make it my peculiar study but
at the same time i have not neglect the other branch of science a man would make but a very sorry
chemist if he attend to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish be to become really a
man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch
of natural philosophy include mathematics

he then take me into his laboratory and explain to me the us of his various machine instruct me a to
what i ought to procure and promise me the use of his own when i should have advance far enough in
the science not to derange their mechanism he also give me the list of book which i have request and
i take my leave

thus end a day memorable to me it decide my future destiny

chapter

from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the
term become nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those work so full of genius and
discrimination which modern inquirer have write on these subject i attend the lecture and cultivate
the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i find even in m krempe a great deal of
sound sense and real information combine it be true with a repulsive physiognomy and manner but not
on that account the less valuable in m waldman i find a true friend his gentleness be never ting by
dogmatism and his instruction be give with an air of frankness and good nature that banish every
idea of pedantry in a thousand way he smooth for me the path of knowledge and make the most abstruse
inquiry clear and facile to my apprehension my application be at first fluctuating and uncertain it
gain strength a i proceed and soon become so ardent and eager that the star often disappear in the
light of morning whilst i be yet engage in my laboratory

a i apply so closely it may be easily conceive that my progress be rapid my ardour be indeed the
astonishment of the student and my proficiency that of the master professor krempe often ask me with
a sly smile how cornelius agrippa go on whilst m waldman express the most heartfelt exultation in my
progress two year pass in this manner during which i pay no visit to geneva but be engage heart and
soul in the pursuit of some discovery which i hop to make none but those who have experience them
can conceive of the enticement of science in other study you go as far a others have go before you
and there be nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there be continual food for discovery
and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursue one study must infallibly arrive at
great proficiency in that study and i who continually seek the attainment of one object of pursuit
and be solely wrap up in this improve so rapidly that at the end of two year i make some discovery
in the improvement of some chemical instrument which procure me great esteem and admiration at the
university when i have arrive at this point and have become as well acquaint with the theory and
practice of natural philosophy a depend on the lesson of any of the professor at ingolstadt my
residence there be no longer conducive to my improvement i thought of return to my friend and my
native town when an incident happen that protracted my stay

one of the phenomenon which have peculiarly attract my attention be the structure of the human frame
and indeed any animal endue with life whence i often ask myself do the principle of life proceed it
be a bold question and one which have ever be consider a a mystery yet with how many thing be we
upon the brink of become acquaint if cowardice or carelessness do not restrain our inquiry i revolve
these circumstance in my mind and determine thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those
branch of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i have be animate by an almost
supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have be irksome and almost intolerable to
examine the cause of life we must first have recourse to death i become acquaint with the science of
anatomy but this be not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human
body in my education my father have take the great precaution that my mind should be impress with no
supernatural horror i do not ever remember to have tremble at a tale of superstition or to have fear
the apparition of a spirit darkness have no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard be to me merely
the receptacle of body deprive of life which from be the seat of beauty and strength have become
food for the worm now i be lead to examine the cause and progress of this decay and force to spend
day and night in vault and charnel house my attention be fix upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feeling i saw how the fine form of man be degrade and
waste i behold the corruption of death succeed to the bloom cheek of life i saw how the worm inherit
the wonder of the eye and brain i pause examine and analyse all the minutia of causation a exemplify
in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden
light break in upon me a light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i become dizzy
with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrate i be surprise that among so many men of
genius who have direct their inquiry towards the same science that i alone should be reserve to
discover so astonish a secret

remember i be not record the vision of a madman the sun do not more certainly shine in the heaven
than that which i now affirm be true some miracle might have produce it yet the stage of the
discovery be distinct and probable after day and night of incredible labour and fatigue i succeed in
discover the cause of generation and life nay more i become myself capable of bestow animation upon
lifeless matter

the astonishment which i have at first experience on this discovery soon give place to delight and
rapture after so much time spend in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desire be
the most gratifying consummation of my toil but this discovery be so great and overwhelming that all
the step by which i have be progressively lead to it be obliterate and i beheld only the result what
have be the study and desire of the wise men since the creation of the world be now within my grasp
not that like a magic scene it all open upon me at once the information i have obtain be of a nature
rather to direct my endeavour so soon a i should point them towards the object of my search than to
exhibit that object already accomplish i be like the arabian who have be bury with the dead and find
a passage to life aid only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light

i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eye express my friend that you expect to
be inform of the secret with which i be acquaint that can not be listen patiently until the end of
my story and you will easily perceive why i be reserve upon that subject i will not lead you on
unguarded and ardent a i then be to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by
my precept at least by my example how dangerous be the acquirement of knowledge and how much happy
that man be who believe his native town to be the world than he who aspire to become great than his
nature will allow

when i find so astonish a power place within my hand i hesitate a long time concern the manner in
which i should employ it although i possess the capacity of bestow animation yet to prepare a frame
for the reception of it with all it intricacy of fibre muscle and vein still remain a work of
inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubt at first whether i should attempt the creation of a be
like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination be too much exalt by my first success
to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal a complex and wonderful a man the
material at present within my command hardly appear adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i
doubt not that i should ultimately succeed i prepare myself for a multitude of revers my operation
might be incessantly baffle and at last my work be imperfect yet when i consider the improvement
which every day take place in science and mechanic i be encourage to hope my present attempt would
at least lay the foundation of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of
my plan a any argument of it impracticability it be with these feeling that i begin the creation of
a human be a the minuteness of the part form a great hindrance to my speed i resolve contrary to my
first intention to make the be of a gigantic stature that be to say about eight foot in height and
proportionably large after have form this determination and have spend some month in successfully
collect and arrange my material i begin

no one can conceive the variety of feeling which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first
enthusiasm of success life and death appear to me ideal bound which i should first break through and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new specie would bless me a it creator and source many
happy and excellent nature would owe their be to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child
so completely a i should deserve theirs pursue these reflection i think that if i could bestow
animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now find it impossible renew
life where death have apparently devote the body to corruption

these thought support my spirit while i pursue my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek have
grow pale with study and my person have become emaciate with confinement sometimes on the very brink
of certainty i fail yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise
one secret which i alone possess be the hope to which i have dedicate myself and the moon gaze on my
midnight labour while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursue nature to her hiding place
who shall conceive the horror of my secret toil a i dabble among the unhallowed damp of the grave or
torture the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limb now tremble and my eye swim with the
remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urge me forward i seem to have lose all
soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it be indeed but a passing trance that only make me feel
with renewed acuteness so soon a the unnatural stimulus cease to operate i have return to my old
habit i collect bone from charnel house and disturb with profane finger the tremendous secret of the
human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separate from all the
other apartment by a gallery and staircase i keep my workshop of filthy creation my eyeball be start
from their socket in attend to the detail of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughter
house furnish many of my material and often do my human nature turn with loathe from my occupation
whilst still urge on by an eagerness which perpetually increase i bring my work near to a conclusion

the summer month pass while i be thus engage heart and soul in one pursuit it be a most beautiful
season never do the field bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vine yield a more luxuriant vintage
but my eye be insensible to the charm of nature and the same feeling which make me neglect the scene
around me cause me also to forget those friend who be so many mile absent and whom i have not see
for so long a time i know my silence disquiet them and i well remember the word of my father i know
that while you be pleased with yourself you will think of u with affection and we shall hear
regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence a a proof
that your other duty be equally neglected

i know well therefore what would be my father feeling but i could not tear my thought from my
employment loathsome in itself but which have take an irresistible hold of my imagination i wish a
it be to procrastinate all that relate to my feeling of affection until the great object which
swallow up every habit of my nature should be complete

i then think that my father would be unjust if he ascribe my neglect to vice or faultiness on my
part but i be now convinced that he be justify in conceive that i should not be altogether free from
blame a human be in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow
passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of
knowledge be an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself have a tendency to
weaken your affection and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasure in which no alloy can
possibly mix then that study be certainly unlawful that be to say not befit the human mind if this
rule be always observe if no man allow any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of
his domestic affection greece have not be enslave csar would have spar his country america would
have be discover more gradually and the empire of mexico and peru have not be destroy

but i forget that i be moralize in the most interesting part of my tale and your look remind me to
proceed

my father make no reproach in his letter and only take notice of my silence by inquire into my
occupation more particularly than before winter spring and summer pass away during my labour but i
do not watch the blossom or the expand leaf sight which before always yield me supreme delight so
deeply be i engross in my occupation the leaf of that year have wither before my work draw near to a
close and now every day show me more plainly how well i have succeed but my enthusiasm be check by
my anxiety and i appear rather like one doom by slavery to toil in the mine or any other unwholesome
trade than an artist occupy by his favourite employment every night i be oppress by a slow fever and
i become nervous to a most painful degree the fall of a leaf startle me and i shun my fellow
creature a if i have be guilty of a crime sometimes i grow alarm at the wreck i perceive that i have
become the energy of my purpose alone sustain me my labour would soon end and i believe that
exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promise myself both of these
when my creation should be complete

chapter

it be on a dreary night of november that i behold the accomplishment of my toil with an anxiety that
almost amount to agony i collect the instrument of life around me that i might infuse a spark of be
into the lifeless thing that lay at my foot it be already one in the morning the rain patter
dismally against the pane and my candle be nearly burn out when by the glimmer of the half
extinguish light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathe hard and a convulsive
motion agitate it limb

how can i describe my emotion at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such
infinite pain and care i have endeavour to form his limb be in proportion and i have select his
feature a beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely cover the work of muscle and artery
beneath his hair be of a lustrous black and flow his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these
luxuriance only form a more horrid contrast with his watery eye that seem almost of the same colour
a the dun white socket in which they be set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lip

the different accident of life be not so changeable a the feeling of human nature i have work hard
for nearly two year for the sole purpose of infuse life into an inanimate body for this i have
deprive myself of rest and health i have desire it with an ardour that far exceed moderation but now
that i have finish the beauty of the dream vanish and breathless horror and disgust fill my heart
unable to endure the aspect of the be i have create i rush out of the room and continue a long time
traverse my bed chamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeed to the tumult
i have before endured and i throw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavour to seek a few moment of
forgetfulness but it be in vain i sleep indeed but i be disturb by the wild dream i think i saw
elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the street of ingolstadt delight and surprise i embrace
her but a i imprint the first kiss on her lip they become livid with the hue of death her feature
appear to change and i think that i hold the corpse of my dead mother in my arm a shroud envelop her
form and i saw the grave worm crawl in the fold of the flannel i start from my sleep with horror a
cold dew cover my forehead my teeth chatter and every limb become convulse when by the dim and
yellow light of the moon a it force it way through the window shutter i behold the wretch the
miserable monster whom i have create he hold up the curtain of the bed and his eye if eye they may
be call be fix on me his jaw open and he mutter some inarticulate sound while a grin wrinkle his
cheek he might have speak but i do not hear one hand be stretch out seemingly to detain me but i
escape and rush downstairs i take refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabit
where i remain during the rest of the night walk up and down in the great agitation listen
attentively catch and fear each sound a if it be to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse
to which i have so miserably give life

oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endue with animation could
not be so hideous a that wretch i have gaze on him while unfinished he be ugly then but when those
muscle and joint be render capable of motion it become a thing such a even dante could not have
conceive

i pass the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the
palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme
weakness mingle with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dream that have be my food
and pleasant rest for so long a space be now become a hell to me and the change be so rapid the
overthrow so complete

morning dismal and wet at length dawn and discover to my sleepless and ache eye the church of
ingolstadt it white steeple and clock which indicate the sixth hour the porter open the gate of the
court which have that night be my asylum and i issue into the street pace them with quick step a if
i seek to avoid the wretch whom i fear every turning of the street would present to my view i do not
dare return to the apartment which i inhabit but felt impel to hurry on although drench by the rain
which pour from a black and comfortless sky

i continue walk in this manner for some time endeavour by bodily exercise to ease the load that
weigh upon my mind i traverse the street without any clear conception of where i be or what i be do
my heart palpitate in the sickness of fear and i hurry on with irregular step not dare to look about
me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and have once turn round walk on and
turn no more his head because he know a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridge
ancient mariner

continue thus i come at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligence and carriage
usually stop here i pause i know not why but i remain some minute with my eye fix on a coach that be
come towards me from the other end of the street a it draw nearer i observe that it be the swiss
diligence it stop just where i be stand and on the door be open i perceive henry clerval who on see
me instantly spring out my dear frankenstein exclaim he how glad i be to see you how fortunate that
you should be here at the very moment of my alighting

nothing could equal my delight on see clerval his presence bring back to my thought my father
elizabeth and all those scene of home so dear to my recollection i grasp his hand and in a moment
forgot my horror and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many month calm and
serene joy i welcome my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walk towards my college
clerval continue talk for some time about our mutual friend and his own good fortune in be permit to
come to ingolstadt you may easily believe say he how great be the difficulty to persuade my father
that all necessary knowledge be not comprise in the noble art of book keep and indeed i believe i
leave him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaty be the same a
that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield i have ten thousand florin a year without
greek i eat heartily without greek but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of
learning and he have permit me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge

it give me the great delight to see you but tell me how you leave my father brother and elizabeth

very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to
lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein continue he stop short and
gaze full in my face i do not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look a if
you have be watch for several night

you have guess right i have lately be so deeply engage in one occupation that i have not allow
myself sufficient rest a you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employment be now at an
end and that i be at length free

i tremble excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrence of the
precede night i walk with a quick pace and we soon arrive at my college i then reflect and the
thought make me shiver that the creature whom i have leave in my apartment might still be there
alive and walk about i dread to behold this monster but i fear still more that henry should see him
entreat him therefore to remain a few minute at the bottom of the stair i dart up towards my own
room my hand be already on the lock of the door before i recollect myself i then pause and a cold
shivering come over me i throw the door forcibly open a child be accustom to do when they expect a
spectre to stand in wait for them on the other side but nothing appear i step fearfully in the
apartment be empty and my bedroom be also free from it hideous guest i could hardly believe that so
great a good fortune could have befall me but when i become assure that my enemy have indeed flee i
clap my hand for joy and run down to clerval

we ascend into my room and the servant presently bring breakfast but i be unable to contain myself
it be not joy only that possess me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse
beat rapidly i be unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jump over the chair clap
my hand and laugh aloud clerval at first attribute my unusual spirit to joy on his arrival but when
he observe me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eye for which he could not account and my
loud unrestrained heartless laughter frighten and astonish him

my dear victor cry he what for god sake be the matter do not laugh in that manner how ill you be
what be the cause of all this

do not ask me cried i put my hand before my eye for i think i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the
room he can tell oh save me save me i imagine that the monster seize me i struggle furiously and
fell down in a fit

poor clerval what must have be his feeling a meeting which he anticipate with such joy so strangely
turn to bitterness but i be not the witness of his grief for i be lifeless and do not recover my
sens for a long long time

this be the commencement of a nervous fever which confine me for several month during all that time
henry be my only nurse i afterwards learn that know my father advance age and unfitness for so long
a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spar them this grief by conceal the
extent of my disorder he know that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and
firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he do not doubt that instead of do harm he perform the kind
action that he could towards them

but i be in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attention of my
friend could have restore me to life the form of the monster on whom i have bestow existence be for
ever before my eye and i rave incessantly concern him doubtless my word surprise henry he at first
believe them to be the wandering of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i
continually recur to the same subject persuade him that my disorder indeed owe it origin to some
uncommon and terrible event

by very slow degree and with frequent relapse that alarm and grieve my friend i recover i remember
the first time i become capable of observe outward object with any kind of pleasure i perceive that
the fallen leaf have disappear and that the young bud be shoot forth from the tree that shade my
window it be a divine spring and the season contribute greatly to my convalescence i felt also
sentiment of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappear and in a short time i become as
cheerful a before i be attack by the fatal passion

dear clerval exclaim i how kind how very good you be to me this whole winter instead of be spend in
study a you promise yourself have be consume in my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel the
great remorse for the disappointment of which i have be the occasion but you will forgive me

you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast a you can and
since you appear in such good spirit i may speak to you on one subject may i not

i tremble one subject what could it be could he allude to an object on whom i dare not even think

compose yourself say clerval who observe my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitate you
but your father and cousin would be very happy if they receive a letter from you in your own
handwriting they hardly know how ill you have be and be uneasy at your long silence

be that all my dear henry how could you suppose that my first think would not fly towards those dear
dear friend whom i love and who be so deserve of my love

if this be your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that have be lie
here some day for you it be from your cousin i believe

chapter

clerval then put the following letter into my hand it be from my own elizabeth

my dear cousin

you have be ill very ill and even the constant letter of dear kind henry be not sufficient to
reassure me on your account you be forbidden to write to hold a pen yet one word from you dear
victor be necessary to calm our apprehension for a long time i have think that each post would bring
this line and my persuasion have restrain my uncle from undertake a journey to ingolstadt i have
prevent his encounter the inconvenience and perhaps danger of so long a journey yet how often have i
regret not be able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attend on your sickbed
have devolve on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wish nor minister to them with
the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that be over now clerval writes that indeed you be
get well i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting

get well and return to u you will find a happy cheerful home and friend who love you dearly your
father health be vigorous and he ask but to see you but to be assure that you be well and not a care
will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our
ernest he be now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he be desirous to be a true swiss and to
enter into foreign service but we can not part with him at least until his elder brother return to u
my uncle be not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never
have your power of application he look upon study a an odious fetter his time be spend in the open
air climb the hill or row on the lake i fear that he will become an idle unless we yield the point
and permit him to enter on the profession which he have select

little alteration except the growth of our dear child have take place since you leave u the blue
lake and snow clad mountain they never change and i think our placid home and our content heart be
regulate by the same immutable law my trifling occupation take up my time and amuse me and i be
reward for any exertion by see none but happy kind face around me since you leave u but one change
have take place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz enter our
family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few word madame moritz her
mother be a widow with four child of whom justine be the third this girl have always be the
favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after
the death of m moritz treat her very ill my aunt observe this and when justine be twelve year of age
prevail on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institution of our country
have produce simpler and happy manner than those which prevail in the great monarchy that surround
it hence there be less distinction between the several class of it inhabitant and the low order be
neither so poor nor so despise their manner be more refined and moral a servant in geneva do not
mean the same thing a a servant in france and england justine thus receive in our family learn the
duty of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country do not include the idea of ignorance
and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human be

justine you may remember be a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remark that if you
be in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto give
concern the beauty of angelica she look so frank hearted and happy my aunt conceive a great
attachment for her by which she be induce to give her an education superior to that which she have
at first intend this benefit be fully repay justine be the most grateful little creature in the
world i do not mean that she make any profession i never hear one pas her lip but you could see by
her eye that she almost adore her protectress although her disposition be gay and in many respect
inconsiderate yet she pay the great attention to every gesture of my aunt she think her the model of
all excellence and endeavour to imitate her phraseology and manner so that even now she often remind
me of her

when my dear aunt die every one be too much occupy in their own grief to notice poor justine who
have attend her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine be very ill but
other trial be reserve for her

one by one her brother and sister die and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter be
leave childless the conscience of the woman be trouble she begin to think that the death of her
favourite be a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she be a roman catholic and i
believe her confessor confirm the idea which she have conceive accordingly a few month after your
departure for ingolstadt justine be call home by her repentant mother poor girl she weep when she
quit our house she be much alter since the death of my aunt grief have give softness and a win
mildness to her manner which have before be remarkable for vivacity nor be her residence at her
mother house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman be very vacillate in her repentance
she sometimes beg justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accuse her of have cause the
death of her brother and sister perpetual fretting at length throw madame moritz into a decline
which at first increase her irritability but she be now at peace for ever she die on the first
approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine have just return to u and i
assure you i love her tenderly she be very clever and gentle and extremely pretty a i mention before
her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt

i must say also a few word to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him
he be very tall of his age with sweet laugh blue eye dark eyelash and curl hair when he smile two
little dimple appear on each cheek which be rosy with health he have already have one or two little
wife but louisa biron be his favourite a pretty little girl of five year of age

now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulge in a little gossip concern the good people of
geneva the pretty miss mansfield have already receive the congratulatory visit on her approaching
marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon marry m duvillard the rich
banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir have suffer several misfortune since the
departure of clerval from geneva but he have already recover his spirit and be report to be on the
point of marry a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she be a widow and much old than manoir
but she be very much admire and a favourite with everybody

i have write myself into good spirit dear cousin but my anxiety return upon me a i conclude write
dearest victor one line one word will be a blessing to u ten thousand thanks to henry for his
kindness his affection and his many letter we be sincerely grateful adieu my cousin take care of
yourself and i entreat you write

elizabeth lavenza

geneva march

dear dear elizabeth i exclaim when i have read her letter i will write instantly and relieve them
from the anxiety they must feel i write and this exertion greatly fatigue me but my convalescence
have commence and proceed regularly in another fortnight i be able to leave my chamber

one of my first duty on my recovery be to introduce clerval to the several professor of the
university in do this i undergo a kind of rough usage ill befit the wound that my mind have sustain
ever since the fatal night the end of my labour and the beginning of my misfortune i have conceive a
violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i be otherwise quite restore to health
the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptom henry saw this
and have remove all my apparatus from my view he have also change my apartment for he perceive that
i have acquire a dislike for the room which have previously be my laboratory but these care of
clerval be make of no avail when i visit the professor m waldman inflict torture when he praise with
kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i have make in the science he soon perceive that i
dislike the subject but not guess the real cause he attribute my feeling to modesty and change the
subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire a i evidently saw of draw me out
what could i do he mean to please and he torment me i felt a if he have place carefully one by one
in my view those instrument which be to be afterwards use in put me to a slow and cruel death i
writhe under his word yet dare not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eye and feeling be always
quick in discern the sensation of others decline the subject allege in excuse his total ignorance
and the conversation take a more general turn i thank my friend from my heart but i do not speak i
saw plainly that he be surprised but he never attempt to draw my secret from me and although i love
him with a mixture of affection and reverence that know no bound yet i could never persuade myself
to confide in him that event which be so often present to my recollection but which i fear the
detail to another would only impress more deeply

m krempe be not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable
sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomium give me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m
waldman d n the fellow cry he why m clerval i assure you he have outstript u all ay stare if you
please but it be nevertheless true a youngster who but a few year ago believe in cornelius agrippa
as firmly a in the gospel have now set himself at the head of the university and if he be not soon
pull down we shall all be out of countenance ay ay continue he observe my face expressive of suffer
m frankenstein be modest an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of
themselves you know m clerval i be myself when young but that wear out in a very short time

m krempe have now commence an eulogy on himself which happily turn the conversation from a subject
that be so annoy to me

clerval have never sympathise in my taste for natural science and his literary pursuit differ wholly
from those which have occupy me he come to the university with the design of make himself complete
master of the oriental language and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he have mark
out for himself resolve to pursue no inglorious career he turn his eye toward the east a afford
scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit language engage his attention and
i be easily induce to enter on the same study idleness have ever be irksome to me and now that i
wish to fly from reflection and hat my former study i felt great relief in be the fellow pupil with
my friend and find not only instruction but consolation in the work of the orientalist i do not like
him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialect for i do not contemplate make any other use of
them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repay my
labour their melancholy be soothe and their joy elevate to a degree i never experience in study the
author of any other country when you read their writing life appear to consist in a warm sun and a
garden of rose in the smile and frown of a fair enemy and the fire that consume your own heart how
different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome

summer pass away in these occupation and my return to geneva be fix for the latter end of autumn but
be delay by several accident winter and snow arrive the road be deem impassable and my journey be
retard until the ensue spring i felt this delay very bitterly for i long to see my native town and
my beloved friend my return have only be delay so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a
strange place before he have become acquaint with any of it inhabitant the winter however be spend
cheerfully and although the spring be uncommonly late when it come it beauty compensate for it
dilatoriness

the month of may have already commence and i expect the letter daily which be to fix the date of my
departure when henry propose a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a
personal farewell to the country i have so long inhabited i accede with pleasure to this proposition
i be fond of exercise and clerval have always be my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
that i have take among the scene of my native country

we pass a fortnight in these perambulation my health and spirit have long be restore and they gain
additional strength from the salubrious air i breathe the natural incident of our progress and the
conversation of my friend study have before seclude me from the intercourse of my fellow creature
and render me unsocial but clerval call forth the good feeling of my heart he again teach me to love
the aspect of nature and the cheerful face of child excellent friend how sincerely you do love me
and endeavour to elevate my mind until it be on a level with your own a selfish pursuit have cramp
and narrow me until your gentleness and affection warm and open my sens i become the same happy
creature who a few year ago love and beloved by all have no sorrow or care when happy inanimate
nature have the power of bestow on me the most delightful sensation a serene sky and verdant field
fill me with ecstasy the present season be indeed divine the flower of spring bloom in the hedge
while those of summer be already in bud i be undisturbed by thought which during the precede year
have press upon me notwithstanding my endeavour to throw them off with an invincible burden

henry rejoice in my gaiety and sincerely sympathise in my feeling he exert himself to amuse me while
he express the sensation that fill his soul the resource of his mind on this occasion be truly
astonish his conversation be full of imagination and very often in imitation of the persian and
arabic writer he invent tale of wonderful fancy and passion at other time he repeat my favourite
poem or draw me out into argument which he support with great ingenuity

we return to our college on a sunday afternoon the peasant be dance and every one we meet appeared
gay and happy my own spirit be high and i bound along with feeling of unbridled joy and hilarity

chapter

on my return i find the following letter from my father

i will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstance of the transaction

last thursday may i my niece and your two brother go to walk in plainpalais the evening be warm and
serene and we prolong our walk far than usual it be already dusk before we think of return and then
we discover that william and ernest who have go on before be not to be find we accordingly rest on a
seat until they should return presently ernest come and enquired if we have see his brother he say
that he have be play with him that william have run away to hide himself and that he vainly seek for
him and afterwards wait for a long time but that he do not return

this account rather alarm u and we continue to search for him until night fell when elizabeth

alphonse frankenstein

geneva may

clerval who have watch my countenance a i read this letter be surprise to observe the despair that
succeed the joy i at first express on receive news from my friend i throw the letter on the table
and cover my face with my hand

my dear frankenstein exclaim henry when he perceive me weep with bitterness be you always to be
unhappy my dear friend what have happen

i motion him to take up the letter while i walk up and down the room in the extreme agitation tear
also gush from the eye of clerval a he read the account of my misfortune

i can offer you no consolation my friend say he your disaster be irreparable what do you intend to
do

to go instantly to geneva come with me henry to order the horse

during our walk clerval endeavour to say a few word of consolation he could only express his
heartfelt sympathy poor william say he dear lovely child he now sleep with his angel mother who that
have see him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so
miserably to feel the murderer grasp how much more a murder that could destroy radiant innocence
poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friend mourn and weep but he be at rest the pang
be over his suffering be at an end for ever a sod cover his gentle form and he know no pain he can
no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivor

clerval speak thus a we hurry through the street the word impress themselves on my mind and i
remember them afterwards in solitude but now as soon a the horse arrive i hurry into a cabriolet and
bade farewell to my friend

my journey be very melancholy at first i wish to hurry on for i long to console and sympathise with
my loved and sorrowing friend but when i draw near my native town i slacken my progress i could
hardly sustain the multitude of feeling that crowd into my mind i pass through scene familiar to my
youth but which i have not see for nearly six year how altered every thing might be during that time
one sudden and desolate change have take place but a thousand little circumstance might have by
degree work other alteration which although they be do more tranquilly might not be the less
decisive fear overcame me i dare no advance dread a thousand nameless evils that make me tremble
although i be unable to define them

i remain two day at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplate the lake the water be
placid all around be calm and the snowy mountains the palace of nature be not change by degree the
calm and heavenly scene restore me and i continue my journey towards geneva

the road ran by the side of the lake which become narrow a i approach my native town i discover more
distinctly the black side of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i weep like a child dear
mountain my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summit be clear the sky and
lake be blue and placid be this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness

i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwell on these preliminary circumstance but
they be day of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country
who but a native can tell the delight i take in again behold thy stream thy mountain and more than
all thy lovely lake

yet a i draw near home grief and fear again overcame me night also close around and when i could
hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appear a vast and dim scene of
evil and i foresaw obscurely that i be destine to become the most wretched of human being alas i
prophesy truly and fail only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagine and dread i
do not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i be destine to endure

it be completely dark when i arrive in the environs of geneva the gate of the town be already shut
and i be oblige to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the
city the sky be serene and a i be unable to rest i resolve to visit the spot where my poor william
have be murder a i could not pass through the town i be oblige to cross the lake in a boat to arrive
at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in
the most beautiful figure the storm appear to approach rapidly and on land i ascend a low hill that
i might observe it progress it advance the heaven be cloud and i soon felt the rain come slowly in
large drop but it violence quickly increase

i quit my seat and walk on although the darkness and storm increase every minute and the thunder
burst with a terrific crash over my head it be echo from saleve the juras and the alp of savoy vivid
flash of lightning dazzle my eye illuminate the lake make it appear like a vast sheet of fire then
for an instant every thing seem of a pitchy darkness until the eye recover itself from the precede
flash the storm a be often the case in switzerland appear at once in various part of the heaven the
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lie between the
promontory of belrive and the village of copet another storm enlighten jura with faint flash and
another darken and sometimes disclose the mole a peaked mountain to the east of the lake

while i watch the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wander on with a hasty step this noble war in
the sky elevate my spirit i clasp my hand and exclaim aloud william dear angel this be thy funeral
this thy dirge a i say these word i perceive in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump
of tree near me i stand fixed gaze intently i could not be mistake a flash of lightning illuminate
the object and discover it shape plainly to me it gigantic stature and the deformity of it aspect
more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly inform me that it be the wretch the filthy dmon to
whom i have give life what do he there could he be i shudder at the conception the murderer of my
brother no sooner do that idea cross my imagination than i become convinced of it truth my teeth
chatter and i be force to lean against a tree for support the figure pass me quickly and i lose it
in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroy the fair child he be the murderer i could not
doubt it the mere presence of the idea be an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursue the
devil but it would have be in vain for another flash discover him to me hang among the rock of the
nearly perpendicular ascent of mont saleve a hill that bound plainpalais on the south he soon reach
the summit and disappear

i remain motionless the thunder cease but the rain still continue and the scene be envelop in an
impenetrable darkness i revolve in my mind the event which i have until now seek to forget the whole
train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the work of my own hand at my bedside it
departure two year have now nearly elapse since the night on which he first receive life and be this
his first crime ala i have turn loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight be in carnage
and misery have he not murder my brother

no one can conceive the anguish i suffer during the remainder of the night which i spend cold and
wet in the open air but i do not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination be busy in
scene of evil and despair i consider the be whom i have cast among mankind and endow with the will
and power to effect purpose of horror such a the deed which he have now do nearly in the light of my
own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and force to destroy all that be dear to me

day dawn and i direct my step towards the town the gate be open and i hasten to my father house my
first thought be to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be make but i
pause when i reflect on the story that i have to tell a be whom i myself have form and endue with
life have meet me at midnight among the precipice of an inaccessible mountain i remember also the
nervous fever with which i have be seize just at the time that i date my creation and which would
give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well know that if any other have
communicate such a relation to me i should have look upon it a the raving of insanity besides the
strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i be so far credit a to persuade my
relative to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of
scale the overhang side of mont saleve these reflection determine me and i resolve to remain silent

it be about five in the morning when i enter my father house i tell the servant not to disturb the
family and go into the library to attend their usual hour of rise

six year have elapse pass in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stand in the same place where
i have last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he
still remain to me i gaze on the picture of my mother which stand over the mantel piece it be an
historical subject paint at my father desire and represent caroline beaufort in an agony of despair
kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb be rustic and her cheek pale but there be an air
of dignity and beauty that hardly permit the sentiment of pity below this picture be a miniature of
william and my tear flow when i look upon it while i be thus engage ernest enter he have hear me
arrive and hasten to welcome me welcome my dear victor say he ah i wish you have come three month
ago and then you would have find u all joyous and delight you come to u now to share a misery which
nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seem sink under his
misfortune and your persuasion will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and torment self
accusation poor william he be our darling and our pride

tear unrestrained fell from my brother eye a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i have
only imagine the wretchedness of my desolate home the reality come on me a a new and a not less
terrible disaster i try to calm ernest i enquire more minutely concern my father and here i name my
cousin

she most of all say ernest require consolation she accuse herself of have cause the death of my
brother and that make her very wretched but since the murderer have be discover

the murderer discover good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it be impossible one
might as well try to overtake the wind or confine a mountain stream with a straw i saw him too he be
free last night

i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accent of wonder but to u the discovery we have
make completes our misery no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be
convince notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who be so
amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appal a crime

justine moritz poor poor girl be she the accused but it be wrongfully every one know that no one
believe it surely ernest

no one do at first but several circumstance come out that have almost force conviction upon u and
her own behaviour have be so confused a to add to the evidence of fact a weight that i fear leave no
hope for doubt but she will be try today and you will then hear all

he then relate that the morning on which the murder of poor william have be discover justine have be
take ill and confine to her bed for several day during this interval one of the servant happen to
examine the apparel she have wear on the night of the murder have discover in her pocket the picture
of my mother which have be judge to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly show it
to one of the others who without say a word to any of the family go to a magistrate and upon their
deposition justine be apprehend on be charge with the fact the poor girl confirm the suspicion in a
great measure by her extreme confusion of manner

this be a strange tale but it do not shake my faith and i reply earnestly you be all mistaken i know
the murderer justine poor good justine be innocent

at that instant my father enter i saw unhappiness deeply impress on his countenance but he endeavour
to welcome me cheerfully and after we have exchange our mournful greeting would have introduce some
other topic than that of our disaster have not ernest exclaim good god papa victor say that he know
who be the murderer of poor william

we do also unfortunately reply my father for indeed i have rather have be for ever ignorant than
have discover so much depravity and ungratitude in one i value so highly

my dear father you be mistaken justine be innocent

if she be god forbid that she should suffer a guilty she be to be try today and i hope i sincerely
hope that she will be acquit

this speech calm me i be firmly convince in my own mind that justine and indeed every human be be
guiltless of this murder i have no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be bring
forward strong enough to convict her my tale be not one to announce publicly it astound horror would
be look upon a madness by the vulgar do any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe
unless his sens convince him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash
ignorance which i have let loose upon the world

we be soon join by elizabeth time have alter her since i last behold her it have endow her with
loveliness surpass the beauty of her childish year there be the same candour the same vivacity but
it be ally to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcome me with the great
affection your arrival my dear cousin say she fill me with hope you perhaps will find some mean to
justify my poor guiltless justine ala who be safe if she be convict of crime i rely on her innocence

darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love be to be tear away by even a bad fate if she be
condemn i never shall know joy more but she will not i be sure she will not and then i shall be
happy again even after the sad death of my little william

by the assurance of her acquittal

know that it be impossible and to see every one else prejudice in so deadly a manner render me
hopeless and despair she weep

dear niece say my father dry your tear if she be a you believe innocent rely on the justice of our
law and the activity with which i shall prevent the slight shadow of partiality

chapter

we pass a few sad hour until eleven oclock when the trial be to commence my father and the rest of
the family be oblige to attend a witness i accompany them to the court during the whole of this
wretched mockery of justice i suffer living torture it be to be decide whether the result of my
curiosity and lawless device would cause the death of two of my fellow being one a smiling babe full
of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murder with every aggravation of infamy that
could make the murder memorable in horror justine also be a girl of merit and possessed quality
which promise to render her life happy now all be to be obliterate in an ignominious grave and i the
cause a thousand time rather would i have confess myself guilty of the crime ascribe to justine but
i be absent when it be commit and such a declaration would have be consider a the raving of a madman
and would not have exculpate her who suffer through me

the appearance of justine be calm she be dress in mourning and her countenance always engage be
render by the solemnity of her feeling exquisitely beautiful yet she appear confident in innocence
and do not tremble although gaze on and execrate by thousand for all the kindness which her beauty
might otherwise have excite be obliterate in the mind of the spectator by the imagination of the
enormity she be suppose to have commit she be tranquil yet her tranquillity be evidently constrain
and a her confusion have before be adduce a a proof of her guilt she work up her mind to an
appearance of courage when she enter the court she throw her eye round it and quickly discover where
we be seat a tear seem to dim her eye when she saw u but she quickly recover herself and a look of
sorrowful affection seem to attest her utter guiltlessness

the trial begin and after the advocate against her have state the charge several witness be call
several strange fact combine against her which might have stagger anyone who have not such proof of
her innocence a i have she have be out the whole of the night on which the murder have be commit and
towards morning have be perceive by a market woman not far from the spot where the body of the
murdered child have be afterwards find the woman ask her what she do there but she look very
strangely and only return a confused and unintelligible answer she return to the house about eight
oclock and when one inquire where she have pass the night she reply that she have be look for the
child and demand earnestly if anything have be hear concern him when show the body she fell into
violent hysteric and keep her bed for several day the picture be then produce which the servant have
find in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice prove that it be the same which an hour
before the child have be miss she have place round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation fill
the court

justine be call on for her defence a the trial have proceed her countenance have alter surprise
horror and misery be strongly express sometimes she struggle with her tear but when she be desire to
plead she collect her power and speak in an audible although variable voice

god know she say how entirely i be innocent but i do not pretend that my protestation should acquit
me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the fact which have be adduce against me
and i hope the character i have always bear will incline my judge to a favourable interpretation
where any circumstance appear doubtful or suspicious

she then relate that by the permission of elizabeth she have pass the evening of the night on which
the murder have be commit at the house of an aunt at chene a village situate at about a league from
geneva on her return at about nine oclock she meet a man who ask her if she have see anything of the
child who be lose she be alarm by this account and pass several hour in look for him when the gate
of geneva be shut and she be force to remain several hour of the night in a barn belonging to a
cottage be unwilling to call up the inhabitant to whom she be well know most of the night she spend
here watch towards morning she believe that she sleep for a few minute some step disturb her and she
awake it be dawn and she quit her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she
have go near the spot where his body lay it be without her knowledge that she have be bewilder when
question by the market woman be not surprising since she have pass a sleepless night and the fate of
poor william be yet uncertain concern the picture she could give no account

i know continue the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me
but i have no power of explain it and when i have express my utter ignorance i be only left to
conjecture concern the probability by which it might have be place in my pocket but here also i be
check i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have be so wicked a to destroy
me wantonly do the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afford him for so do or if i
have why should he have steal the jewel to part with it again so soon

i commit my cause to the justice of my judge yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a
few witness examine concern my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt i must be condemn although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence

several witness be call who have know her for many year and they speak well of her but fear and
hatred of the crime of which they suppose her guilty render them timorous and unwilling to come
forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent disposition and irreproachable conduct
about to fail the accuse when although violently agitate she desire permission to address the court

i be say she the cousin of the unhappy child who be murder or rather his sister for i be educate by
and have live with his parent ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judge
indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish
through the cowardice of her pretended friend i wish to be allow to speak that i may say what i know
of her character i be well acquaint with the accuse i have live in the same house with her at one
time for five and at another for nearly two year during all that period she appear to me the most
amiable and benevolent of human creature she nurse madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness
with the great affection and care and afterwards attend her own mother during a tedious illness in a
manner that excite the admiration of all who know her after which she again live in my uncle house
where she be beloved by all the family she be warmly attach to the child who be now dead and acted
towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that
notwithstanding all the evidence produce against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she
have no temptation for such an action a to the bauble on which the chief proof rest if she have
earnestly desire it i should have willingly give it to her so much do i esteem and value her

a murmur of approbation follow elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it be excite by her
generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation be turn with
renewed violence charge her with the black ingratitude she herself weep a elizabeth spoke but she do
not answer my own agitation and anguish be extreme during the whole trial i believe in her innocence
i know it could the dmon who have i do not for a minute doubt murder my brother also in his hellish
sport have betray the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation
and when i perceive that the popular voice and the countenance of the judge have already condemn my
unhappy victim i rush out of the court in agony the torture of the accuse do not equal mine she be
sustain by innocence but the fang of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold

i pass a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i go to the court my lip and throat be parch
i dare not ask the fatal question but i be know and the officer guess the cause of my visit the
ballot have be throw they be all black and justine be condemn

i can not pretend to describe what i then felt i have before experienced sensation of horror and i
have endeavour to bestow upon them adequate expression but word can not convey an idea of the heart
sicken despair that i then endure the person to whom i address myself add that justine have already
confess her guilt that evidence he observe be hardly require in so glare a case but i be glad of it
and indeed none of our judge like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so
decisive

this be strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean have my eye deceive me and be i
really as mad a the whole world would believe me to be if i disclose the object of my suspicion i
hasten to return home and elizabeth eagerly demand the result

my cousin reply i it be decide a you may have expect all judge have rather that ten innocent should
suffer than that one guilty should escape but she have confess

this be a dire blow to poor elizabeth who have rely with firmness upon justines innocence ala say
she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i love and esteem a my sister how
could she put on those smile of innocence only to betray her mild eye seem incapable of any severity
or guile and yet she have commit a murder

soon after we hear that the poor victim have express a desire to see my cousin my father wish her
not to go but say that he leave it to her own judgment and feeling to decide yes say elizabeth i
will go although she be guilty and you victor shall accompany me i can not go alone the idea of this
visit be torture to me yet i could not refuse

we enter the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sit on some straw at the farther end her hand
be manacle and her head rest on her knees she rise on see u enter and when we be leave alone with
her she throw herself at the foot of elizabeth weep bitterly my cousin wept also

oh justine say she why do you rob me of my last consolation i rely on your innocence and although i
be then very wretched i be not so miserable a i be now

and do you also believe that i be so very very wicked do you also join with my enemy to crush me to
condemn me a a murderer her voice be suffocate with sob

rise my poor girl say elizabeth why do you kneel if you be innocent i be not one of your enemy i
believe you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i hear that you have yourself declare
your guilt that report you say be false and be assure dear justine that nothing can shake my
confidence in you for a moment but your own confession

i do confess but i confess a lie i confess that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lie
heavy at my heart than all my other sin the god of heaven forgive me ever since i be condemn my
confessor have besiege me he threaten and menace until i almost begin to think that i be the monster
that he say i be he threaten excommunication and hell fire in my last moment if i continue obdurate
dear lady i have none to support me all look on me a a wretch doom to ignominy and perdition what
could i do in an evil hour i subscribe to a lie and now only be i truly miserable

she pause weep and then continue i think with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your
justine whom your blessed aunt have so highly honoured and whom you love be a creature capable of a
crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrate dear william dear bless child i soon
shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that console me go a i be to suffer
ignominy and death

oh justine forgive me for have for one moment distrust you why do you confess but do not mourn dear
girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony heart of your
enemy by my tear and prayer you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the
scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune

justine shake her head mournfully i do not fear to die she say that pang be past god raise my
weakness and give me courage to endure the bad i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me
and think of me a of one unjustly condemn i be resign to the fate await me learn from me dear lady
to submit in patience to the will of heaven

during this conversation i have retire to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the
horrid anguish that possess me despair who dare talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow be to
pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not a i do such deep and bitter agony i gnash my
teeth and grind them together utter a groan that come from my inmost soul justine start when she saw
who it be she approach me and say dear sir you be very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe
that i be guilty

i could not answer no justine say elizabeth he be more convinced of your innocence than i be for
even when he hear that you have confess he do not credit it

i truly thank him in these last moment i feel the sincere gratitude towards those who think of me
with kindness how sweet be the affection of others to such a wretch a i be it remove more than half
my misfortune and i feel a if i could die in peace now that my innocence be acknowledge by you dear
lady and your cousin

thus the poor sufferer try to comfort others and herself she indeed gain the resignation she desire
but i the true murderer felt the never die worm alive in my bosom which allow of no hope or
consolation elizabeth also weep and be unhappy but hers also be the misery of innocence which like a
cloud that pass over the fair moon for a while hide but can not tarnish it brightness anguish and
despair have penetrate into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could
extinguish we stay several hour with justine and it be with great difficulty that elizabeth could
tear herself away i wish cry she that i be to die with you i can not live in this world of misery

justine assume an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repress her bitter tear she embrace
elizabeth and say in a voice of half suppress emotion farewell sweet lady dear elizabeth my beloved
and only friend may heaven in it bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that
you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so

and on the morrow justine die elizabeths heart rend eloquence fail to move the judge from their
settle conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeal be
lose upon them and when i receive their cold answer and hear the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these
men my purposed avowal die away on my lip thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the
sentence pass upon my wretched victim she perish on the scaffold a a murderess

from the torture of my own heart i turn to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth
this also be my do and my father woe and the desolation of that late so smile home all be the work
of my thrice accurse hand ye weep unhappy one but these be not your last tear again shall you raise
the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentation shall again and again be hear frankenstein your
son your kinsman your early much love friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your
sake who have no think nor sense of joy except a it be mirror also in your dear countenance who
would fill the air with blessing and spend his life in serve you he bid you weep to shed countless
tear happy beyond his hope if thus inexorable fate be satisfy and if the destruction pause before
the peace of the grave have succeed to your sad torment

thus speak my prophetic soul a tear by remorse horror and despair i behold those i love spend vain
sorrow upon the graf of william and justine the first hapless victim to my unhallowed art

chapter

nothing be more painful to the human mind than after the feeling have be work up by a quick
succession of event the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follow and deprive the soul
both of hope and fear justine die she rest and i be alive the blood flow freely in my vein but a
weight of despair and remorse press on my heart which nothing could remove sleep flee from my eye i
wander like an evil spirit for i have commit deed of mischief beyond description horrible and more
much more i persuade myself be yet behind yet my heart overflow with kindness and the love of virtue
i have begin life with benevolent intention and thirst for the moment when i should put them in
practice and make myself useful to my fellow being now all be blast instead of that serenity of
conscience which allow me to look back upon the past with self satisfaction and from thence to
gather promise of new hope i be seize by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurry me away to a
hell of intense torture such a no language can describe

this state of mind prey upon my health which have perhaps never entirely recover from the first
shock it have sustain i shun the face of man all sound of joy or complacency be torture to me
solitude be my only consolation deep dark deathlike solitude

my father observe with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habit and endeavour by
argument deduce from the feeling of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with
fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brood over me do you think
victor say he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i love your brother tear
come into his eye a he speak but be it not a duty to the survivor that we should refrain from
augment their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it be also a duty owe to yourself for
excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without
which no man be fit for society

this advice although good be totally inapplicable to my case i should have be the first to hide my
grief and console my friend if remorse have not mingle it bitterness and terror it alarm with my
other sensation now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide
myself from his view

about this time we retire to our house at belrive this change be particularly agreeable to me the
shutting of the gate regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remain on the lake after that
hour have render our residence within the wall of geneva very irksome to me i be now free often
after the rest of the family have retire for the night i take the boat and pass many hour upon the
water sometimes with my sail set i be carry by the wind and sometimes after row into the middle of
the lake i leave the boat to pursue it own course and give way to my own miserable reflection i be
often tempt when all be at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wander restless in a
scene so beautiful and heavenly if i except some bat or the frog whose harsh and interrupt croaking
be hear only when i approach the shore often i say i be tempt to plunge into the silent lake that
the water might close over me and my calamity for ever but i be restrain when i thought of the
heroic and suffer elizabeth whom i tenderly love and whose existence be bind up in mine i think also
of my father and survive brother should i by my base desertion leave them expose and unprotected to
the malice of the fiend whom i have let loose among them

at these moment i weep bitterly and wish that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford
them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguish every hope i have be the
author of unalterable evil and i live in daily fear lest the monster whom i have create should
perpetrate some new wickedness i have an obscure feeling that all be not over and that he would
still commit some signal crime which by it enormity should almost efface the recollection of the
past there be always scope for fear so long a anything i love remain behind my abhorrence of this
fiend can not be conceive when i thought of him i gnash my teeth my eye become inflamed and i
ardently wish to extinguish that life which i have so thoughtlessly bestow when i reflect on his
crime and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bound of moderation i would have make a pilgrimage
to the high peak of the andes could i when there have precipitate him to their base i wish to see
him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the death of
william and justine

our house be the house of mourn my father health be deeply shake by the horror of the recent event
elizabeth be sad and despond she no longer take delight in her ordinary occupation all pleasure seem
to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tear she then think be the just tribute she should
pay to innocence so blasted and destroy she be no long that happy creature who in early youth wander
with me on the bank of the lake and talk with ecstasy of our future prospect the first of those
sorrow which be send to wean u from the earth have visit her and it dimming influence quench her
dearest smile

when i reflect my dear cousin say she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the
world and it work a they before appear to me before i look upon the account of vice and injustice
that i read in book or heard from others a tale of ancient day or imaginary evil at least they be
remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery have come home and men
appear to me a monster thirst for each others blood yet i be certainly unjust everybody believe that
poor girl to be guilty and if she could have commit the crime for which she suffer assuredly she
would have be the most depraved of human creature for the sake of a few jewel to have murder the son
of her benefactor and friend a child whom she have nurse from it birth and appear to love a if it
have be her own i could not consent to the death of any human be but certainly i should have think
such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she be innocent i know i feel she be
innocent you be of the same opinion and that confirm me alas victor when falsehood can look so like
the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel a if i be walk on the edge of a
precipice towards which thousand be crowd and endeavour to plunge me into the abyss william and
justine be assassinate and the murderer escape he walk about the world free and perhaps respect but
even if i be condemn to suffer on the scaffold for the same crime i would not change place with such
a wretch

i listen to this discourse with the extreme agony i not in deed but in effect be the true murderer
elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly take my hand say my dear friend you must calm
yourself these event have affect me god know how deeply but i be not so wretched a you be there be
an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that make me tremble dear
victor banish these dark passion remember the friend around you who centre all their hope in you
have we lose the power of render you happy ah while we love while we be true to each other here in
this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil bless what can disturb
our peace

and could not such word from her whom i fondly prize before every other gift of fortune suffice to
chase away the fiend that lurk in my heart even a she speak i draw near to her a if in terror lest
at that very moment the destroyer have be near to rob me of her

thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul
from woe the very accent of love be ineffectual i be encompass by a cloud which no beneficial
influence could penetrate the wounded deer drag it fainting limb to some untrodden brake there to
gaze upon the arrow which have pierce it and to die be but a type of me

sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelm me but sometimes the whirlwind passion
of my soul drive me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my
intolerable sensation it be during an access of this kind that i suddenly leave my home and bend my
step towards the near alpine valley seek in the magnificence the eternity of such scene to forget
myself and my ephemeral because human sorrow my wandering be direct towards the valley of chamounix
i have visit it frequently during my boyhood six year have pass since then i be a wreck but nought
have change in those savage and endure scene

i perform the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hire a mule a the more sure foot
and least liable to receive injury on these rugged road the weather be fine it be about the middle
of the month of august nearly two month after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i
date all my woe the weight upon my spirit be sensibly lighten a i plunge yet deeper in the ravine of
arve the immense mountain and precipice that overhang me on every side the sound of the river raging
among the rock and the dashing of the waterfall around spoke of a power mighty a omnipotence and i
cease to fear or to bend before any be less almighty than that which have create and rule the
element here display in their most terrific guise still a i ascend high the valley assume a more
magnificent and astonishing character ruin castle hang on the precipice of piny mountains the
impetuous arve and cottage every here and there peep forth from among the tree form a scene of
singular beauty but it be augment and render sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining
pyramid and dome tower above all a belonging to another earth the habitation of another race of
being

i pass the bridge of pelissier where the ravine which the river form open before me and i begin to
ascend the mountain that overhang it soon after i enter the valley of chamounix this valley be more
wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque a that of servox through which i have
just pass the high and snowy mountain be it immediate boundary but i saw no more ruined castle and
fertile field immense glacier approach the road i hear the rumble thunder of the fall avalanche and
mark the smoke of it passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raise itself from the
surround aiguilles and it tremendous dome overlook the valley

a tingling long lose sense of pleasure often come across me during this journey some turn in the
road some new object suddenly perceive and recognise remind me of day go by and be associate with
the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very wind whisper in soothe accent and maternal nature bid me
weep no more then again the kindly influence cease to act i find myself fetter again to grief and
indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spur on my animal strive so to forget the world my
fear and more than all myself or in a more desperate fashion i alight and throw myself on the grass
weigh down by horror and despair

at length i arrive at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeed to the extreme fatigue both of
body and of mind which i have endure for a short space of time i remain at the window watch the
pallid lightning that play above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursue it
noisy way beneath the same lulling sound act a a lullaby to my too keen sensation when i place my
head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it a it come and bless the giver of oblivion

chapter

i spend the following day roam through the valley i stand beside the source of the arveiron which
take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace be advance down from the summit of the hill to
barricade the valley the abrupt side of vast mountain be before me the icy wall of the glacier
overhung me a few shattered pine be scatter around and the solemn silence of this glorious presence
chamber of imperial nature be break only by the brawling wave or the fall of some vast fragment the
thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberate along the mountain of the accumulated ice
which through the silent working of immutable law be ever and anon rent and tear a if it have be but
a plaything in their hand these sublime and magnificent scene afford me the great consolation that i
be capable of receive they elevate me from all littleness of feeling and although they do not remove
my grief they subdue and tranquillise it in some degree also they divert my mind from the thought
over which it have brood for the last month i retire to rest at night my slumber a it be wait on and
minister to by the assemblance of grand shape which i have contemplate during the day they
congregate round me the unstained snowy mountain top the glittering pinnacle the pine wood and rag
bare ravine the eagle soar amidst the cloud they all gather round me and bid me be at peace

where have they flee when the next morning i awake all of soul inspirit flee with sleep and dark
melancholy cloud every thought the rain be pour in torrent and thick mist hide the summit of the
mountain so that i even saw not the face of those mighty friend still i would penetrate their misty
veil and seek them in their cloudy retreat what be rain and storm to me my mule be bring to the door
and i resolve to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remember the effect that the view of the
tremendous and ever move glacier have produce upon my mind when i first saw it it have then fill me
with a sublime ecstasy that give wing to the soul and allow it to soar from the obscure world to
light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature have indeed always the effect of
solemnise my mind and cause me to forget the passing care of life i determine to go without a guide
for i be well acquaint with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur
of the scene

the ascent be precipitous but the path be cut into continual and short winding which enable you to
surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it be a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spot
the trace of the winter avalanche may be perceive where tree lie broken and strew on the ground some
entirely destroy others bent lean upon the jutting rock of the mountain or transversely upon other
tree the path a you ascend high be intersect by ravine of snow down which stone continually roll
from above one of them be particularly dangerous a the slight sound such a even speak in a loud
voice produce a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the
pine be not tall or luxuriant but they be sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i look on
the valley beneath vast mist be rise from the river which run through it and curl in thick wreath
around the opposite mountain whose summit be hide in the uniform cloud while rain pour from the dark
sky and add to the melancholy impression i receive from the object around me alas why do man boast
of sensibility superior to those apparent in the brute it only render them more necessary being if
our impulse be confine to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we be move by
every wind that blow and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to u

we rest a dream have power to poison sleep we rise one wandring think pollutes the day we feel
conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our care away it be the same for be it joy
or sorrow the path of it departure still be free man yesterday may neer be like his morrow nought
may endure but mutability

it be nearly noon when i arrive at the top of the ascent for some time i sit upon the rock that
overlook the sea of ice a mist cover both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze
dissipate the cloud and i descend upon the glacier the surface be very uneven rise like the wave of
a troubled sea descend low and intersperse by rift that sink deep the field of ice be almost a
league in width but i spend nearly two hour in cross it the opposite mountain be a bare
perpendicular rock from the side where i now stand montanvert be exactly opposite at the distance of
a league and above it rise mont blanc in awful majesty i remain in a recess of the rock gaze on this
wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among it dependent
mountain whose aerial summit hang over it recess their icy and glitter peak shone in the sunlight
over the cloud my heart which be before sorrowful now swell with something like joy i exclaim wander
spirit if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow bed allow me this faint happiness or take
me a your companion away from the joy of life

a i say this i suddenly behold the figure of a man at some distance advance towards me with
superhuman speed he bound over the crevice in the ice among which i have walk with caution his
stature also a he approach seem to exceed that of man i be trouble a mist come over my eye and i
felt a faintness seize me but i be quickly restore by the cold gale of the mountain i perceive a the
shape come nearer sight tremendous and abhor that it be the wretch whom i have create i tremble with
rage and horror resolve to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approach
his countenance bespeak bitter anguish combine with disdain and malignity while it unearthly
ugliness render it almost too horrible for human eye but i scarcely observe this rage and hatred
have at first deprive me of utterance and i recover only to overwhelm him with word expressive of
furious detestation and contempt

devil i exclaim do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreak on
your miserable head begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i

me thy compassion by the virtue that i once possess i demand this from you hear my tale it be long
and strange and the temperature of this place be not fit to your fine sensation come to the hut upon
the mountain the sun be yet high in the heaven before it descend to hide itself behind your snowy
precipice and illuminate another world you will have hear my story and can decide on you it rest
whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of
your fellow creature and the author of your own speedy ruin

a he say this he lead the way across the ice i follow my heart be full and i do not answer him but a
i proceed i weigh the various argument that he have use and determine at least to listen to his tale
i be partly urge by curiosity and compassion confirm my resolution i have hitherto suppose him to be
the murderer of my brother and i eagerly seek a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first
time also i felt what the duty of a creator towards his creature be and that i ought to render him
happy before i complain of his wickedness these motif urge me to comply with his demand we cross the
ice therefore and ascend the opposite rock the air be cold and the rain again begin to descend we
enter the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirit but i
consent to listen and seat myself by the fire which my odious companion have light he thus begin his
tale

chapter

it be with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my be all the event of that
period appear confuse and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensation seize me and i saw felt
heard and smelt at the same time and it be indeed a long time before i learn to distinguish between
the operation of my various sens by degree i remember a strong light press upon my nerve so that i
be oblige to shut my eye darkness then come over me and trouble me but hardly have i felt this when
by open my eye a i now suppose the light pour in upon me again i walk and i believe descend but i
presently find a great alteration in my sensation before dark and opaque body have surround me
impervious to my touch or sight but i now find that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacle
which i could not either surmount or avoid the light become more and more oppressive to me and the
heat weary me a i walk i seek a place where i could receive shade this be the forest near ingolstadt
and here i lay by the side of a brook rest from my fatigue until i felt torment by hunger and thirst
this rouse me from my nearly dormant state and i eat some berry which i find hang on the tree or lie
on the ground i slake my thirst at the brook and then lie down be overcome by sleep

it be dark when i awake i felt cold also and half frighten a it be instinctively find myself so
desolate before i have quit your apartment on a sensation of cold i have cover myself with some
clothes but these be insufficient to secure me from the dew of night i be a poor helpless miserable
wretch i know and could distinguish nothing but feel pain invade me on all side i sit down and weep

soon a gentle light stole over the heaven and give me a sensation of pleasure i start up and behold
a radiant form rise from among the tree the moon i gaze with a kind of wonder it move slowly but it
enlighten my path and i again go out in search of berry i be still cold when under one of the tree i
find a huge cloak with which i cover myself and sit down upon the ground no distinct idea occupy my
mind all be confuse i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sound ring in my ear
and on all side various scent salute me the only object that i could distinguish be the bright moon
and i fix my eye on that with pleasure

several change of day and night pass and the orb of night have greatly lessen when i begin to
distinguish my sensation from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supply me
with drink and the tree that shade me with their foliage i be delighted when i first discover that a
pleasant sound which often salute my ear proceed from the throat of the little winged animal who
have often intercept the light from my eye i begin also to observe with great accuracy the form that
surround me and to perceive the boundary of the radiant roof of light which canopy me sometimes i
try to imitate the pleasant song of the bird but be unable sometimes i wish to express my sensation
in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sound which break from me frighten me into silence
again

the moon have disappear from the night and again with a lessened form show itself while i still
remain in the forest my sensation have by this time become distinct and my mind receive every day
additional idea my eye become accustomed to the light and to perceive object in their right form i
distinguish the insect from the herb and by degree one herb from another i find that the sparrow
utter none but harsh note whilst those of the blackbird and thrush be sweet and entice

one day when i be oppress by cold i find a fire which have be leave by some wandering beggar and be
overcome with delight at the warmth i experience from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live
ember but quickly draw it out again with a cry of pain how strange i think that the same cause
should produce such opposite effect i examine the material of the fire and to my joy find it to be
compose of wood i quickly collect some branch but they be wet and would not burn i be pain at this
and sit still watch the operation of the fire the wet wood which i have place near the heat dry and
itself become inflamed i reflect on this and by touch the various branch i discover the cause and
busy myself in collect a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of
fire when night come on and bring sleep with it i be in the great fear l my fire should be
extinguish i cover it carefully with dry wood and leaf and place wet branch upon it and then spread
my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep

it be morning when i awake and my first care be to visit the fire i uncover it and a gentle breeze
quickly fan it into a flame i observe this also and contrive a fan of branch which rouse the ember
when they be nearly extinguish when night come again i find with pleasure that the fire give light
as well a heat and that the discovery of this element be useful to me in my food for i find some of
the offal that the traveller have leave have be roast and taste much more savoury than the berry i
gather from the tree i try therefore to dress my food in the same manner place it on the live ember
i find that the berry be spoil by this operation and the nut and root much improve

food however become scarce and i often spend the whole day search in vain for a few acorn to assuage
the pang of hunger when i find this i resolve to quit the place that i have hitherto inhabit to seek
for one where the few want i experience would be more easily satisfy in this emigration i
exceedingly lament the loss of the fire which i have obtain through accident and know not how to
reproduce it i give several hour to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i be oblige to
relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrap myself up in my cloak i strike across the wood towards
the set sun i pass three day in these ramble and at length discover the open country a great fall of
snow have take place the night before and the field be of one uniform white the appearance be
disconsolate and i find my foot chill by the cold damp substance that cover the ground

it be about seven in the morning and i long to obtain food and shelter at length i perceive a small
hut on a rise ground which have doubtless be build for the convenience of some shepherd this be a
new sight to me and i examine the structure with great curiosity find the door open i enter an old
man sit in it near a fire over which he be prepare his breakfast he turn on hear a noise and
perceive me shriek loudly and quit the hut run across the field with a speed of which his debilitate
form hardly appear capable his appearance different from any i have ever before see and his flight
somewhat surprise me but i be enchant by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not
penetrate the ground be dry and it present to me then a exquisite and divine a retreat a pandmonium
appear to the dmons of hell after their suffering in the lake of fire i greedily devour the remnant
of the shepherd breakfast which consist of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i do not
like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep

it be noon when i awoke and allure by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground
i determine to recommence my travel and deposit the remains of the peasant breakfast in a wallet i
find i proceed across the field for several hour until at sunset i arrive at a village how
miraculous do this appear the hut the neater cottage and stately house engage my admiration by turn
the vegetable in the garden the milk and cheese that i saw place at the window of some of the
cottage allure my appetite one of the best of these i enter but i have hardly place my foot within
the door before the child shriek and one of the woman faint the whole village be rouse some flee
some attack me until grievously bruise by stone and many other kind of missile weapon i escape to
the open country and fearfully take refuge in a low hovel quite bare and make a wretched appearance
after the palace i have behold in the village this hovel however join a cottage of a neat and
pleasant appearance but after my late dearly buy experience i dare not enter it my place of refuge
be construct of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however be
place on the earth which form the floor but it be dry and although the wind enter it by innumerable
chink i find it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain

here then i retreat and lay down happy to have find a shelter however miserable from the inclemency
of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon a morning dawn i crept from my kennel
that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i have find
it be situate against the back of the cottage and surround on the side which be expose by a pig sty
and a clear pool of water one part be open and by that i have creep in but now i cover every crevice
by which i might be perceive with stone and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on
occasion to pass out all the light i enjoy come through the sty and that be sufficient for me

have thus arrange my dwelling and carpet it with clean straw i retire for i saw the figure of a man
at a distance and i remember too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i
have first however provide for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloin
and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flow
by my retreat the floor be a little raise so that it be keep perfectly dry and by it vicinity to the
chimney of the cottage it be tolerably warm

be thus provide i resolve to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my
determination it be indeed a paradise compare to the bleak forest my former residence the rain drop
branch and dank earth i eat my breakfast with pleasure and be about to remove a plank to procure
myself a little water when i hear a step and look through a small chink i behold a young creature
with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl be young and of gentle demeanour unlike
what i have since find cottager and farmhouse servant to be yet she be meanly dress a coarse blue
petticoat and a linen jacket be her only garb her fair hair be plait but not adorn she look patient
yet sad i lose sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she return bear the pail which be now
partly fill with milk a she walk along seemingly incommode by the burden a young man meet her whose
countenance express a deep despondence utter a few sound with an air of melancholy he take the pail
from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she follow and they disappear presently i saw the
young man again with some tool in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl be also
busy sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard

on examine my dwelling i find that one of the window of the cottage have formerly occupy a part of
it but the pane have be fill up with wood in one of these be a small and almost imperceptible chink
through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room be visible whitewashed
and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sit an old man lean his head on
his hand in a disconsolate attitude the young girl be occupy in arrange the cottage but presently
she take something out of a drawer which employ her hand and she sit down beside the old man who
take up an instrument begin to play and to produce sound sweet than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale it be a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who have never behold aught beautiful before
the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the age cottager win my reverence while the gentle
manner of the girl entice my love he play a sweet mournful air which i perceive drew tear from the
eye of his amiable companion of which the old man take no notice until she sob audibly he then
pronounce a few sound and the fair creature leave her work knelt at his foot he raise her and smile
with such kindness and affection that i felt sensation of a peculiar and overpower nature they be a
mixture of pain and pleasure such a i have never before experienced either from hunger or cold
warmth or food and i withdraw from the window unable to bear these emotion

soon after this the young man return bear on his shoulder a load of wood the girl meet him at the
door help to relieve him of his burden and take some of the fuel into the cottage place it on the
fire then she and the youth go apart into a nook of the cottage and he show her a large loaf and a
piece of cheese she seem pleased and go into the garden for some root and plant which she place in
water and then upon the fire she afterwards continue her work whilst the young man go into the
garden and appear busily employ in digging and pull up root after he have be employ thus about an
hour the young woman join him and they enter the cottage together

the old man have in the meantime be pensive but on the appearance of his companion he assume a more
cheerful air and they sit down to eat the meal be quickly dispatch the young woman be again occupy
in arrange the cottage the old man walk before the cottage in the sun for a few minute lean on the
arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creature
one be old with silver hair and a countenance beam with benevolence and love the younger be slight
and graceful in his figure and his feature be mould with the fine symmetry yet his eye and attitude
express the utmost sadness and despondency the old man return to the cottage and the youth with tool
different from those he have use in the morning direct his step across the field

night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i find that the cottager have a mean of prolong light
by the use of taper and be delight to find that the setting of the sun do not put an end to the
pleasure i experience in watch my human neighbour in the even the young girl and her companion be
employ in various occupation which i do not understand and the old man again take up the instrument
which produce the divine sound that have enchant me in the morning so soon a he have finish the
youth begin not to play but to utter sound that be monotonous and neither resemble the harmony of
the old man instrument nor the song of the bird i since find that he read aloud but at that time i
know nothing of the science of word or letter

the family after have be thus occupy for a short time extinguish their light and retire a i
conjecture to rest

chapter

i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrence of the day what chiefly strike
me be the gentle manner of these people and i long to join them but dare not i remember too well the
treatment i have suffer the night before from the barbarous villager and resolve whatever course of
conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my
hovel watching and endeavour to discover the motif which influence their action

the cottager arise the next morning before the sun the young woman arrange the cottage and prepare
the food and the youth depart after the first meal

this day be pass in the same routine a that which precede it the young man be constantly employ out
of door and the girl in various laborious occupation within the old man whom i soon perceive to be
blind employ his leisure hour on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love
and respect which the young cottager exhibit towards their venerable companion they perform towards
him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he reward them by his benevolent
smile

they be not entirely happy the young man and his companion often go apart and appear to weep i saw
no cause for their unhappiness but i be deeply affect by it if such lovely creature be miserable it
be less strange that i an imperfect and solitary be should be wretched yet why be these gentle being
unhappy they possess a delightful house for such it be in my eye and every luxury they have a fire
to warm them when chill and delicious viand when hungry they be dress in excellent clothes and still
more they enjoy one anothers company and speech interchange each day look of affection and kindness
what do their tear imply do they really express pain i be at first unable to solve these question
but perpetual attention and time explain to me many appearance which be at first enigmatic

a considerable period elapse before i discover one of the cause of the uneasiness of this amiable
family it be poverty and they suffer that evil in a very distress degree their nourishment consist
entirely of the vegetable of their garden and the milk of one cow which give very little during the
winter when it master could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffer the pang
of hunger very poignantly especially the two young cottager for several time they place food before
the old man when they reserve none for themselves

this trait of kindness move me sensibly i have be accustom during the night to steal a part of their
store for my own consumption but when i find that in do this i inflict pain on the cottager i
abstain and satisfy myself with berry nut and root which i gather from a neighbouring wood

i discover also another mean through which i be enable to assist their labour i find that the youth
spend a great part of each day in collect wood for the family fire and during the night i often take
his tool the use of which i quickly discover and bring home firing sufficient for the consumption of
several day

i remember the first time that i do this the young woman when she open the door in the morning
appear greatly astonish on see a great pile of wood on the outside she utter some word in a loud
voice and the youth join her who also express surprise i observe with pleasure that he do not go to
the forest that day but spend it in repair the cottage and cultivate the garden

by degree i make a discovery of still great moment i find that these people possess a method of
communicate their experience and feeling to one another by articulate sound i perceive that the word
they speak sometimes produced pleasure or pain smile or sadness in the mind and countenance of the
hearer this be indeed a godlike science and i ardently desire to become acquainted with it but i be
baffle in every attempt i make for this purpose their pronunciation be quick and the word they utter
not have any apparent connection with visible object i be unable to discover any clue by which i
could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after have remain
during the space of several revolution of the moon in my hovel i discover the name that be give to
some of the most familiar object of discourse i learn and apply the word fire milk bread and wood i
learn also the name of the cottager themselves the youth and his companion have each of them several
name but the old man have only one which be father the girl be call sister or agatha and the youth
felix brother or son i can not describe the delight i felt when i learn the idea appropriate to each
of these sound and be able to pronounce them i distinguish several other word without be able a yet
to understand or apply them such a good dearest unhappy

i spend the winter in this manner the gentle manner and beauty of the cottager greatly endear them
to me when they be unhappy i felt depress when they rejoice i sympathise in their joy i saw few
human being besides them and if any other happen to enter the cottage their harsh manner and rude
gait only enhance to me the superior accomplishment of my friend the old man i could perceive often
endeavour to encourage his child a sometimes i find that he call them to cast off their melancholy
he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestow pleasure even upon me
agatha listen with respect her eye sometimes fill with tear which she endeavour to wipe away
unperceived but i generally find that her countenance and tone be more cheerful after have listen to
the exhortation of her father it be not thus with felix he be always the sad of the group and even
to my unpractised sens he appear to have suffer more deeply than his friend but if his countenance
be more sorrowful his voice be more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he address the
old man

i could mention innumerable instance which although slight mark the disposition of these amiable
cottager in the midst of poverty and want felix carry with pleasure to his sister the first little
white flower that peep out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she have rise
he clear away the snow that obstruct her path to the milk house draw water from the well and bring
the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he find his store always replenish by
an invisible hand in the day i believe he work sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often
go forth and do not return until dinner yet bring no wood with him at other time he work in the
garden but a there be little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha

this reading have puzzle me extremely at first but by degree i discover that he utter many of the
same sound when he read a when he talk i conjecture therefore that he find on the paper sign for
speech which he understand and i ardently long to comprehend these also but how be that possible
when i do not even understand the sound for which they stand a sign i improve however sensibly in
this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i apply my whole
mind to the endeavour for i easily perceive that although i eagerly long to discover myself to the
cottager i ought not to make the attempt until i have first become master of their language which
knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the
contrast perpetually present to my eye have make me acquainted

i have admire the perfect form of my cottager their grace beauty and delicate complexion but how be
i terrify when i view myself in a transparent pool at first i start back unable to believe that it
be indeed i who be reflect in the mirror and when i become fully convince that i be in reality the
monster that i be i be fill with the bitter sensation of despondence and mortification ala i do not
yet entirely know the fatal effect of this miserable deformity

a the sun become warm and the light of day longer the snow vanish and i behold the bare tree and the
black earth from this time felix be more employed and the heart move indication of impend famine
disappear their food a i afterwards find be coarse but it be wholesome and they procure a
sufficiency of it several new kind of plant spring up in the garden which they dress and these sign
of comfort increase daily a the season advance

the old man lean on his son walk each day at noon when it do not rain a i find it be call when the
heaven pour forth it water this frequently take place but a high wind quickly dry the earth and the
season become far more pleasant than it have be

my mode of life in my hovel be uniform during the morning i attend the motion of the cottager and
when they be disperse in various occupation i sleep the remainder of the day be spend in observe my
friend when they have retire to rest if there be any moon or the night be star light i go into the
wood and collect my own food and fuel for the cottage when i return as often a it be necessary i
clear their path from the snow and perform those office that i have see do by felix i afterwards
find that these labour perform by an invisible hand greatly astonish them and once or twice i hear
them on these occasion utter the word good spirit wonderful but i do not then understand the
signification of these term

my thought now become more active and i long to discover the motif and feeling of these lovely
creature i be inquisitive to know why felix appear so miserable and agatha so sad i think foolish
wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserve people when i sleep or be
absent the form of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flit before
me i look upon them a superior being who would be the arbiter of my future destiny i form in my
imagination a thousand picture of present myself to them and their reception of me i imagine that
they would be disgust until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating word i should first win their
favour and afterwards their love

these thought exhilarate me and lead me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquire the art of
language my organ be indeed harsh but supple and although my voice be very unlike the soft music of
their tone yet i pronounce such word a i understood with tolerable ease it be a the as and the lap
dog yet surely the gentle as whose intention be affectionate although his manner be rude deserve
well treatment than blow and execration

the pleasant shower and genial warmth of spring greatly alter the aspect of the earth men who before
this change seem to have be hide in cave disperse themselves and be employ in various art of
cultivation the bird sing in more cheerful note and the leaf begin to bud forth on the tree happy
happy earth fit habitation for god which so short a time before be bleak damp and unwholesome my
spirit be elevate by the enchant appearance of nature the past be blot from my memory the present be
tranquil and the future gild by bright ray of hope and anticipation of joy

chapter

i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate event that impress me with feeling
which from what i have be have make me what i be

spring advance rapidly the weather become fine and the sky cloudless it surprise me that what before
be desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flower and verdure my sens be gratify
and refresh by a thousand scent of delight and a thousand sight of beauty

it be on one of these day when my cottager periodically rest from labour the old man play on his
guitar and the child listen to him that i observe the countenance of felix be melancholy beyond
expression he sigh frequently and once his father pause in his music and i conjecture by his manner
that he inquire the cause of his son sorrow felix reply in a cheerful accent and the old man be
recommence his music when someone tap at the door

it be a lady on horseback accompany by a country man a a guide the lady be dress in a dark suit and
cover with a thick black veil agatha ask a question to which the stranger only reply by pronounce in
a sweet accent the name of felix her voice be musical but unlike that of either of my friend on hear
this word felix come up hastily to the lady who when she saw him throw up her veil and i behold a
countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shin raven black and curiously braid her
eye be dark but gentle although animate her feature of a regular proportion and her complexion
wondrously fair each cheek ting with a lovely pink

felix seem ravish with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanish from his face and it
instantly express a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believe it capable his eye
sparkle a his cheek flush with pleasure and at that moment i think him as beautiful a the stranger
she appear affected by different feeling wipe a few tear from her lovely eye she hold out her hand
to felix who kiss it rapturously and call her as well a i could distinguish his sweet arabian she do
not appear to understand him but smile he assist her to dismount and dismiss her guide conduct her
into the cottage some conversation take place between him and his father and the young stranger
kneel at the old man foot and would have kiss his hand but he raise her and embrace her
affectionately

i soon perceive that although the stranger uttered articulate sound and appear to have a language of
her own she be neither understood by nor herself understand the cottager they make many sign which i
do not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffuse gladness through the cottage dispel their
sorrow a the sun dissipate the morning mist felix seem peculiarly happy and with smile of delight
welcome his arabian agatha the ever gentle agatha kiss the hand of the lovely stranger and point to
her brother make sign which appear to me to mean that he have be sorrowful until she come some hour
pass thus while they by their countenance express joy the cause of which i do not comprehend
presently i find by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeat after them that
she be endeavour to learn their language and the idea instantly occur to me that i should make use
of the same instruction to the same end the stranger learn about twenty word at the first lesson
most of them indeed be those which i have before understood but i profit by the others

a night come on agatha and the arabian retire early when they separate felix kiss the hand of the
stranger and say good night sweet safie he sit up much longer converse with his father and by the
frequent repetition of her name i conjecture that their lovely guest be the subject of their
conversation i ardently desire to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but
find it utterly impossible

the next morning felix go out to his work and after the usual occupation of agatha be finish the
arabian sat at the foot of the old man and take his guitar play some air so entrancingly beautiful
that they at once drew tear of sorrow and delight from my eye she sing and her voice flow in a rich
cadence swell or die away like a nightingale of the wood

when she have finish she give the guitar to agatha who at first decline it she play a simple air and
her voice accompany it in sweet accent but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man
appear enraptured and say some word which agatha endeavour to explain to safie and by which he
appear to wish to express that she bestow on him the great delight by her music

the day now pass as peaceably a before with the sole alteration that joy have take place of sadness
in the countenance of my friend safie be always gay and happy she and i improve rapidly in the
knowledge of language so that in two month i begin to comprehend most of the word utter by my
protector

in the meanwhile also the black ground be cover with herbage and the green bank intersperse with
innumerable flower sweet to the scent and the eye star of pale radiance among the moonlight woods
the sun become warmer the night clear and balmy and my nocturnal ramble be an extreme pleasure to me
although they be considerably shorten by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never
venture abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i have formerly endure in
the first village which i enter

my day be spend in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast
that i improve more rapidly than the arabian who understand very little and converse in broken
accent whilst i comprehend and could imitate almost every word that be speak

while i improve in speech i also learn the science of letter a it be teach to the stranger and this
open before me a wide field for wonder and delight

the book from which felix instruct safie be volneys ruin of empire i should not have understand the
purport of this book have not felix in read it give very minute explanation he have choose this work
he say because the declamatory style be frame in imitation of the eastern author through this work i
obtain a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empire at present exist in the world
it give me an insight into the manner government and religion of the different nation of the earth i
heard of the slothful asiatic of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecian of the war
and wonderful virtue of the early roman of their subsequent degenerating of the decline of that
mighty empire of chivalry christianity and king i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere
and wept with safie over the hapless fate of it original inhabitant

these wonderful narration inspire me with strange feeling be man indeed at once so powerful so
virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appear at one time a mere scion of the evil
principle and at another a all that can be conceive of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous
man appear the high honour that can befall a sensitive be to be base and vicious a many on record
have be appear the low degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even
why there be law and government but when i hear detail of vice and bloodshed my wonder cease and i
turn away with disgust and loathing

every conversation of the cottager now open new wonder to me while i listen to the instruction which
felix bestow upon the arabian the strange system of human society be explain to me i heard of the
division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood

the word induce me to turn towards myself i learn that the possession most esteem by your fellow
creature be high and unsullied descent unite with rich a man might be respect with only one of these
advantage but without either he be consider except in very rare instance a a vagabond and a slave
doom to waste his power for the profit of the choose few and what be i of my creation and creator i
be absolutely ignorant but i know that i possess no money no friends no kind of property i be
besides endue with a figure hideously deform and loathsome i be not even of the same nature a man i
be more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extreme of heat and cold with
less injury to my frame my stature far exceed theirs when i look around i saw and heard of none like
me be i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men flee and whom all men disown

i can not describe to you the agony that these reflection inflict upon me i try to dispel them but
sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i have for ever remain in my native wood nor know nor
felt beyond the sensation of hunger thirst and heat

of what a strange nature be knowledge it cling to the mind when it have once seize on it like a
lichen on the rock i wish sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learn that there be
but one mean to overcome the sensation of pain and that be death a state which i fear yet do not
understand i admire virtue and good feeling and love the gentle manner and amiable quality of my
cottager but i be shut out from intercourse with them except through mean which i obtain by stealth
when i be unseen and unknown and which rather increase than satisfy the desire i have of become one
among my fellow the gentle word of agatha and the animated smile of the charm arabian be not for me
the mild exhortation of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix be not for me
miserable unhappy wretch

other lesson be impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sex and the birth
and growth of child how the father dot on the smile of the infant and the lively sally of the old
child how all the life and care of the mother be wrap up in the precious charge how the mind of
youth expand and gain knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationship which bind one
human be to another in mutual bond

but where be my friend and relation no father have watch my infant day no mother have bless me with
smile and caress or if they have all my past life be now a blot a blind vacancy in which i
distinguish nothing from my early remembrance i have be a i then be in height and proportion i have
never yet see a be resemble me or who claim any intercourse with me what be i the question again
recur to be answer only with groan

i will soon explain to what these feeling tend but allow me now to return to the cottager whose
story excite in me such various feeling of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminate in
additional love and reverence for my protector for so i love in an innocent half painful self deceit
to call them

chapter

some time elapse before i learn the history of my friend it be one which could not fail to impress
itself deeply on my mind unfolding a it do a number of circumstance each interesting and wonderful
to one so utterly inexperienced a i be

the name of the old man be de lacey he be descend from a good family in france where he have live
for many year in affluence respect by his superior and beloved by his equal his son be breed in the
service of his country and agatha have rank with lady of the high distinction a few month before my
arrival they have live in a large and luxurious city call paris surround by friend and possess of
every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompany by a moderate fortune could
afford

the father of safie have be the cause of their ruin he be a turkish merchant and have inhabit paris
for many year when for some reason which i could not learn he become obnoxious to the government he
be seize and cast into prison the very day that safie arrive from constantinople to join him he be
try and condemn to death the injustice of his sentence be very flagrant all paris be indignant and
it be judge that his religion and wealth rather than the crime allege against him have be the cause
of his condemnation

felix have accidentally be present at the trial his horror and indignation be uncontrollable when he
hear the decision of the court he make at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then look
around for the mean after many fruitless attempt to gain admittance to the prison he find a strongly
grate window in an unguarded part of the building which light the dungeon of the unfortunate
muhammadan who load with chain wait in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visit
the grate at night and make know to the prisoner his intention in his favour the turk amaze and
delight endeavour to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promise of reward and wealth felix reject
his offer with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who be allow to visit her father and who by
her gesture express her lively gratitude the youth could not help own to his own mind that the
captive possess a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard

the turk quickly perceive the impression that his daughter have make on the heart of felix and
endeavour to secure him more entirely in his interest by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon
a he should be convey to a place of safety felix be too delicate to accept this offer yet he look
forward to the probability of the event a to the consummation of his happiness

during the ensuing day while the preparation be go forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal
of felix be warm by several letter that he receive from this lovely girl who find mean to express
her thought in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who
understand french she thank him in the most ardent term for his intended service towards her parent
and at the same time she gently deplore her own fate

i have copy of these letter for i find mean during my residence in the hovel to procure the
implement of writing and the letter be often in the hand of felix or agatha before i depart i will
give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present a the sun be already far
decline i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you

safie relate that her mother be a christian arab seize and make a slave by the turk recommend by her
beauty she have win the heart of the father of safie who marry her the young girl speak in high and
enthusiastic term of her mother who bear in freedom spurn the bondage to which she be now reduce she
instruct her daughter in the tenet of her religion and teach her to aspire to high power of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female follower of muhammad this lady die
but her lesson be indelibly impress on the mind of safie who sicken at the prospect of again return
to asia and be immure within the wall of a harem allow only to occupy herself with infantile
amusement ill suit to the temper of her soul now accustom to grand idea and a noble emulation for
virtue the prospect of marry a christian and remain in a country where woman be allow to take a rank
in society be enchant to her

the day for the execution of the turk be fix but on the night previous to it he quit his prison and
before morning be distant many league from paris felix have procure passport in the name of his
father sister and himself he have previously communicate his plan to the former who aid the deceit
by quit his house under the pretence of a journey and conceal himself with his daughter in an
obscure part of paris

felix conduct the fugitive through france to lyon and across mont cenis to leghorn where the
merchant have decide to wait a favourable opportunity of pass into some part of the turkish dominion

safie resolve to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk
renew his promise that she should be unite to his deliverer and felix remain with them in
expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoy the society of the arabian who exhibit
towards him the simplest and tender affection they converse with one another through the mean of an
interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of look and safie sang to him the divine air of
her native country

the turk allow this intimacy to take place and encourage the hope of the youthful lover while in his
heart he have form far other plan he loathe the idea that his daughter should be unite to a
christian but he fear the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he know that he be
still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which
they inhabit he revolve a thousand plan by which he should be enable to prolong the deceit until it
might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he depart his plan be
facilitate by the news which arrive from paris

the government of france be greatly enrage at the escape of their victim and spar no pain to detect
and punish his deliverer the plot of felix be quickly discover and de lacey and agatha be throw into
prison the news reach felix and rouse him from his dream of pleasure his blind and age father and
his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoy the free air and the society of her whom
he love this idea be torture to him he quickly arrange with the turk that if the latter should find
a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain a a
boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quit the lovely arabian he hasten to paris and deliver
himself up to the vengeance of the law hop to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding

he do not succeed they remain confine for five month before the trial take place the result of which
deprive them of their fortune and condemn them to a perpetual exile from their native country

they find a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discover them felix soon learn that
the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endure such unheard of oppression on discover that
his deliverer be thus reduce to poverty and ruin become a traitor to good feeling and honour and
have quit italy with his daughter insultingly send felix a pittance of money to aid him a he say in
some plan of future maintenance

such be the event that prey on the heart of felix and render him when i first saw him the most
miserable of his family he could have endure poverty and while this distress have be the meed of his
virtue he glory in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie be
misfortune more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infuse new life into his soul

when the news reach leghorn that felix be deprive of his wealth and rank the merchant command his
daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous
nature of safie be outrage by this command she attempt to expostulate with her father but he leave
her angrily reiterate his tyrannical mandate

a few day after the turk enter his daughter apartment and tell her hastily that he have reason to
believe that his residence at leghorn have be divulge and that he should speedily be deliver up to
the french government he have consequently hire a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which
city he should sail in a few hour he intend to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
servant to follow at her leisure with the great part of his property which have not yet arrive at
leghorn

when alone safie resolve in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in
this emergency a residence in turkey be abhorrent to her her religion and her feeling be alike
averse to it by some paper of her father which fell into her hand she hear of the exile of her lover
and learn the name of the spot where he then reside she hesitate some time but at length she form
her determination take with her some jewel that belong to her and a sum of money she quit italy with
an attendant a native of leghorn but who understand the common language of turkey and depart for
germany

she arrive in safety at a town about twenty league from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant
fell dangerously ill safie nurse her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl die and the
arabian be leave alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the
custom of the world she fell however into good hand the italian have mention the name of the spot
for which they be bind and after her death the woman of the house in which they have live take care
that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover

chapter

such be the history of my beloved cottager it impress me deeply i learn from the view of social life
which it develop to admire their virtue and to deprecate the vice of mankind

a yet i look upon crime a a distant evil benevolence and generosity be ever present before me incite
within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable quality be call
forth and displayed but in give an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a
circumstance which occur in the beginning of the month of august of the same year

one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collect my own food and bring
home firing for my protector i find on the ground a leathern portmanteau contain several article of
dress and some book i eagerly seize the prize and return with it to my hovel fortunately the book be
write in the language the element of which i have acquire at the cottage they consist of paradise
lose a volume of plutarch life and the sorrow of werter the possession of these treasure give me
extreme delight i now continually study and exercise my mind upon these history whilst my friend be
employ in their ordinary occupation

i can hardly describe to you the effect of these book they produce in me an infinity of new image
and feeling that sometimes raise me to ecstasy but more frequently sink me into the low dejection in
the sorrow of werter besides the interest of it simple and affect story so many opinion be canvass
and so many light thrown upon what have hitherto be to me obscure subject that i find in it a never
end source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manner it describe combine with
lofty sentiment and feeling which have for their object something out of self accord well with my
experience among my protector and with the want which be for ever alive in my own bosom but i think
werter himself a more divine be than i have ever behold or imagine his character contain no
pretension but it sink deep the disquisition upon death and suicide be calculate to fill me with
wonder i do not pretend to enter into the merit of the case yet i inclined towards the opinion of
the hero whose extinction i weep without precisely understand it

a i read however i apply much personally to my own feeling and condition i find myself similar yet
at the same time strangely unlike to the being concern whom i read and to whose conversation i be a
listener i sympathise with and partly understand them but i be unformed in mind i be dependent on
none and relate to none the path of my departure be free and there be none to lament my annihilation
my person be hideous and my stature gigantic what do this mean who be i what be i whence do i come
what be my destination these question continually recur but i be unable to solve them

the volume of plutarch life which i possess contain the history of the first founder of the ancient
republic this book have a far different effect upon me from the sorrow of werter i learn from
werters imagination despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thought he elevate me above
the wretched sphere of my own reflection to admire and love the hero of past age many thing i read
surpass my understanding and experience i have a very confused knowledge of kingdom wide extent of
country mighty river and boundless sea but i be perfectly unacquainted with town and large
assemblage of men the cottage of my protector have be the only school in which i have study human
nature but this book develop new and mighty scene of action i read of men concern in public affair
govern or massacre their specie i felt the great ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for
vice as far a i understand the signification of those term relative a they be a i apply them to
pleasure and pain alone induce by these feeling i be of course lead to admire peaceable lawgiver
numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal life of my protector
cause these impression to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity
have be make by a young soldier burn for glory and slaughter i should have be imbue with different
sensation

but paradise lost excite different and far deep emotion i read it a i have read the other volume
which have fall into my hand a a true history it move every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent god war with his creature be capable of excite i often refer the several
situation a their similarity strike me to my own like adam i be apparently unite by no link to any
other be in existence but his state be far different from mine in every other respect he have come
forth from the hand of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guard by the especial care of his
creator he be allow to converse with and acquire knowledge from being of a superior nature but i be
wretched helpless and alone many time i consider satan a the fitter emblem of my condition for often
like him when i view the bliss of my protector the bitter gall of envy rise within me

another circumstance strengthen and confirm these feeling soon after my arrival in the hovel i
discover some paper in the pocket of the dress which i have take from your laboratory at first i
have neglect them but now that i be able to decipher the character in which they be write i begin to
study them with diligence it be your journal of the four month that precede my creation you minutely
describe in these paper every step you take in the progress of your work this history be mingle with
account of domestic occurrence you doubtless recollect these paper here they be everything be relate
in them which bear reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgust
circumstance which produce it be set in view the minute description of my odious and loathsome
person be give in language which paint your own horror and render mine indelible i sicken a i read
hateful day when i receive life i exclaim in agony accurse creator why do you form a monster so
hideous that even you turn from me in disgust god in pity make man beautiful and alluring after his
own image but my form be a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan
have his companion fellow devil to admire and encourage him but i be solitary and abhor

these be the reflection of my hour of despondency and solitude but when i contemplate the virtue of
the cottager their amiable and benevolent disposition i persuade myself that when they should become
acquainted with my admiration of their virtue they would compassionate me and overlook my personal
deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicit their compassion and
friendship i resolve at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with
them which would decide my fate i postpone this attempt for some month long for the importance
attach to it success inspire me with a dread lest i should fail besides i find that my understanding
improve so much with every day experience that i be unwilling to commence this undertaking until a
few more month should have add to my sagacity

several change in the meantime take place in the cottage the presence of safie diffuse happiness
among it inhabitant and i also find that a great degree of plenty reign there felix and agatha spend
more time in amusement and conversation and be assist in their labour by servant they do not appear
rich but they be content and happy their feeling be serene and peaceful while mine become every day
more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discover to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i be
i cherish hope it be true but it vanish when i behold my person reflect in water or my shadow in the
moonshine even a that frail image and that inconstant shade

i endeavour to crush these fear and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few month i resolve
to undergo and sometimes i allow my thought unchecked by reason to ramble in the field of paradise
and dare to fancy amiable and lovely creature sympathise with my feeling and cheer my gloom their
angelic countenance breathe smile of consolation but it be all a dream no eve soothe my sorrow nor
share my thought i be alone i remember adams supplication to his creator but where be mine he have
abandon me and in the bitterness of my heart i curse him

autumn pass thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaf decay and fall and nature again assume the
barren and bleak appearance it have wear when i first behold the wood and the lovely moon yet i do
not heed the bleakness of the weather i be well fit by my conformation for the endurance of cold
than heat but my chief delight be the sight of the flower the bird and all the gay apparel of summer
when those desert me i turn with more attention towards the cottager their happiness be not decrease
by the absence of summer they love and sympathise with one another and their joy depend on each
other be not interrupt by the casualty that take place around them the more i saw of them the great
become my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearn to be know and love by these
amiable creature to see their sweet look direct towards me with affection be the utmost limit of my
ambition i dare not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that
stop at their door be never drive away i ask it be true for great treasure than a little food or
rest i require kindness and sympathy but i do not believe myself utterly unworthy of it

the winter advance and an entire revolution of the season have take place since i awake into life my
attention at this time be solely directed towards my plan of introduce myself into the cottage of my
protector i revolve many project but that on which i finally fix be to enter the dwelling when the
blind old man should be alone i have sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of
my person be the chief object of horror with those who have formerly behold me my voice although
harsh have nothing terrible in it i think therefore that if in the absence of his child i could gain
the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his mean be tolerate by my young
protector

one day when the sun shone on the red leave that strew the ground and diffuse cheerfulness although
it deny warmth safie agatha and felix depart on a long country walk and the old man at his own
desire be leave alone in the cottage when his child have depart he take up his guitar and play
several mournful but sweet air more sweet and mournful than i have ever hear him play before at
first his countenance be illuminate with pleasure but a he continue thoughtfulness and sadness
succeed at length lay aside the instrument he sit absorb in reflection

my heart beat quick this be the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hope or realise my
fear the servant be go to a neighbouring fair all be silent in and around the cottage it be an
excellent opportunity yet when i proceed to execute my plan my limb fail me and i sank to the ground
again i rise and exert all the firmness of which i be master remove the plank which i have place
before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revive me and with renew determination i
approach the door of their cottage

i knock who be there say the old man come in

i enter pardon this intrusion say i i be a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly
oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minute before the fire

enter say de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your want but unfortunately my
child be from home and a i be blind i be afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you

do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it be warmth and rest only that i need

i sit down and a silence ensue i know that every minute be precious to me yet i remain irresolute in
what manner to commence the interview when the old man address me

by your language stranger i suppose you be my countryman be you french

no but i be educate by a french family and understand that language only i be now go to claim the
protection of some friend whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hope

be they german

no they be french but let u change the subject i be an unfortunate and deserted creature i look
around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never see
me and know little of me i be full of fear for if i fail there i be an outcast in the world for ever

do not despair to be friendless be indeed to be unfortunate but the heart of men when unprejudiced
by any obvious self interest be full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hope and
if these friend be good and amiable do not despair

they be kind they be the most excellent creature in the world but unfortunately they be prejudice
against me i have good disposition my life have be hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial
but a fatal prejudice cloud their eye and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they
behold only a detestable monster

that be indeed unfortunate but if you be really blameless can not you undeceive them

i be about to undertake that task and it be on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terror
i tenderly love these friend i have unknown to them be for many month in the habit of daily kindness
towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it be that prejudice which i wish to
overcome

where do these friend reside

near this spot

the old man pause and then continue if you will unreservedly confide to me the particular of your
tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceive them i be blind and can not judge of your countenance but
there be something in your word which persuade me that you be sincere i be poor and an exile but it
will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature

excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness
and i trust that by your aid i shall not be drive from the society and sympathy of your fellow
creature

heaven forbid even if you be really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not
instigate you to virtue i also be unfortunate i and my family have be condemn although innocent
judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortune

kindness direct towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assure me of

i pause this i think be the moment of decision which be to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for
ever i struggle vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroy all my remain
strength i sink on the chair and sob aloud at that moment i hear the step of my young protector i
have not a moment to lose but seize the hand of the old man i cry now be the time save and protect
me you and your family be the friend whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial

great god exclaim the old man who be you

at that instant the cottage door be open and felix safie and agatha enter who can describe their
horror and consternation on behold me agatha faint and safie unable to attend to her friend rush out
of the cottage felix dart forward and with supernatural force tear me from his father to whose knee
i cling in a transport of fury he dash me to the ground and strike me violently with a stick i could
have tear him limb from limb a the lion rend the antelope but my heart sank within me a with bitter
sickness and i refrain i saw him on the point of repeat his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i
quit the cottage and in the general tumult escape unperceived to my hovel

chapter

curse cursed creator why do i live why in that instant do i not extinguish the spark of existence
which you have so wantonly bestow i know not despair have not yet take possession of me my feeling
be those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroy the cottage and it inhabitant and
have glut myself with their shriek and misery

when night come i quit my retreat and wander in the wood and now no longer restrain by the fear of
discovery i give vent to my anguish in fearful howling i be like a wild beast that have break the
toil destroy the object that obstruct me and range through the wood with a stag like swiftness oh
what a miserable night i pass the cold star shine in mockery and the bare tree wave their branch
above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save
i be at rest or in enjoyment i like the arch fiend bore a hell within me and find myself
unsympathised with wished to tear up the tree spread havoc and destruction around me and then to
have sit down and enjoy the ruin

but this be a luxury of sensation that could not endure i become fatigue with excess of bodily
exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there be none among the myriad
of men that exist who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemy no from
that moment i declare everlasting war against the specie and more than all against him who have form
me and send me forth to this insupportable misery

the sun rise i hear the voice of men and know that it be impossible to return to my retreat during
that day accordingly i hide myself in some thick underwood determine to devote the ensuing hour to
reflection on my situation

the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restore me to some degree of tranquillity and when i
consider what have pass at the cottage i could not help believe that i have be too hasty in my
conclusion i have certainly act imprudently it be apparent that my conversation have interested the
father in my behalf and i be a fool in have expose my person to the horror of his child i ought to
have familiarise the old de lacey to me and by degree to have discover myself to the rest of his
family when they should have be prepare for my approach but i do not believe my error to be
irretrievable and after much consideration i resolve to return to the cottage seek the old man and
by my representation win him to my party

these thought calm me and in the afternoon i sink into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood do
not allow me to be visit by peaceful dream the horrible scene of the precede day be for ever act
before my eye the female be fly and the enraged felix tear me from his father foot i awake exhaust
and find that it be already night i creep forth from my hide place and go in search of food

when my hunger be appease i direct my step towards the well know path that conduct to the cottage
all there be at peace i creep into my hovel and remain in silent expectation of the accustomed hour
when the family arise that hour pass the sun mount high in the heaven but the cottager do not appear
i tremble violently apprehend some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage be dark and i hear
no motion i can not describe the agony of this suspense

presently two countryman pass by but pause near the cottage they enter into conversation use violent
gesticulation but i do not understand what they say a they speak the language of the country which
differ from that of my protector soon after however felix approach with another man i be surprise a
i know that he have not quit the cottage that morning and wait anxiously to discover from his
discourse the meaning of these unusual appearance

do you consider say his companion to him that you will be oblige to pay three month rent and to lose
the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you
will take some day to consider of your determination

it be utterly useless reply felix we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father be
in the great danger owe to the dreadful circumstance that i have relate my wife and my sister will
never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your
tenement and let me fly from this place

felix tremble violently a he say this he and his companion enter the cottage in which they remain
for a few minute and then depart i never saw any of the family of de lacey more

i continue for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my
protector have depart and have break the only link that hold me to the world for the first time the
feeling of revenge and hatred fill my bosom and i do not strive to control them but allow myself to
be bear away by the stream i bend my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friend of
the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eye of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these
thought vanish and a gush of tear somewhat soothe me but again when i reflect that they have spurn
and desert me anger return a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turn my fury
towards inanimate object a night advance i place a variety of combustible around the cottage and
after have destroy every vestige of cultivation in the garden i wait with forced impatience until
the moon have sink to commence my operation

a the night advance a fierce wind arose from the wood and quickly disperse the cloud that have
loiter in the heaven the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produce a kind of insanity in
my spirit that burst all bound of reason and reflection i light the dry branch of a tree and dance
with fury around the devoted cottage my eye still fix on the western horizon the edge of which the
moon nearly touch a part of it orb be at length hid and i wave my brand it sink and with a loud
scream i fire the straw and heath and bush which i have collect the wind fan the fire and the
cottage be quickly envelop by the flame which cling to it and lick it with their forked and destroy
tongue

as soon a i be convince that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quit the scene
and seek for refuge in the wood

and now with the world before me whither should i bend my step i resolve to fly far from the scene
of my misfortune but to me hat and despise every country must be equally horrible at length the
thought of you cross my mind i learn from your paper that you be my father my creator and to whom
could i apply with more fitness than to him who have give me life among the lesson that felix have
bestow upon safie geography have not be omit i have learn from these the relative situation of the
different country of the earth you have mention geneva a the name of your native town and towards
this place i resolve to proceed

but how be i to direct myself i know that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my
destination but the sun be my only guide i do not know the name of the town that i be to pass
through nor could i ask information from a single human be but i do not despair from you only could
i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless
creator you have endow me with perception and passion and then cast me abroad an object for the
scorn and horror of mankind but on you only have i any claim for pity and redress and from you i
determine to seek that justice which i vainly attempt to gain from any other be that wear the human
form

my travel be long and the suffering i endure intense it be late in autumn when i quit the district
where i have so long resided i travel only at night fearful of encounter the visage of a human be
nature decay around me and the sun become heatless rain and snow pour around me mighty river be
freeze the surface of the earth be hard and chill and bare and i find no shelter oh earth how often
do i imprecate curse on the cause of my be the mildness of my nature have flee and all within me be
turn to gall and bitterness the nearer i approach to your habitation the more deeply do i feel the
spirit of revenge enkindle in my heart snow fell and the water be harden but i rest not a few
incident now and then direct me and i possess a map of the country but i often wander wide from my
path the agony of my feeling allow me no respite no incident occur from which my rage and misery
could not extract it food but a circumstance that happen when i arrive on the confines of
switzerland when the sun have recover it warmth and the earth again begin to look green confirm in
an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feeling

i generally rest during the day and travel only when i be secure by night from the view of man one
morning however find that my path lay through a deep wood i venture to continue my journey after the
sun have rise the day which be one of the first of spring cheer even me by the loveliness of it
sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotion of gentleness and pleasure that have long
appear dead revive within me half surprise by the novelty of these sensation i allow myself to be
bear away by them and forget my solitude and deformity dare to be happy soft tear again bedew my
cheek and i even raise my humid eye with thankfulness towards the bless sun which bestow such joy
upon me

i continue to wind among the path of the wood until i come to it boundary which be skirt by a deep
and rapid river into which many of the tree bend their branch now bud with the fresh spring here i
pause not exactly know what path to pursue when i hear the sound of voice that induce me to conceal
myself under the shade of a cypress i be scarcely hid when a young girl come run towards the spot
where i be conceal laughing a if she run from someone in sport she continue her course along the
precipitous side of the river when suddenly her foot slip and she fell into the rapid stream i rush
from my hide place and with extreme labour from the force of the current save her and drag her to
shore she be senseless and i endeavour by every mean in my power to restore animation when i be
suddenly interrupt by the approach of a rustic who be probably the person from whom she have
playfully flee on see me he dart towards me and tear the girl from my arm hasten towards the deep
part of the wood i follow speedily i hardly know why but when the man saw me draw near he aim a gun
which he carry at my body and fire i sink to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness
escape into the wood

this be then the reward of my benevolence i have save a human be from destruction and a a recompense
i now writhe under the miserable pain of a wound which shatter the flesh and bone the feeling of
kindness and gentleness which i have entertain but a few moment before give place to hellish rage
and gnashing of teeth inflame by pain i vow eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the
agony of my wound overcame me my pulse pause and i faint

for some week i lead a miserable life in the wood endeavour to cure the wound which i have receive
the ball have enter my shoulder and i knew not whether it have remain there or pass through at any
rate i have no mean of extract it my suffering be augment also by the oppressive sense of the
injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vow rise for revenge a deep and deadly
revenge such a would alone compensate for the outrage and anguish i have endure

after some week my wound heal and i continue my journey the labour i endure be no long to be
alleviate by the bright sun or gentle breeze of spring all joy be but a mockery which insult my
desolate state and make me feel more painfully that i be not make for the enjoyment of pleasure

but my toil now draw near a close and in two month from this time i reach the environs of geneva

it be even when i arrive and i retire to a hiding place among the field that surround it to meditate
in what manner i should apply to you i be oppress by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy
the gentle breeze of evening or the prospect of the sun set behind the stupendous mountain of jura

at this time a slight sleep relieve me from the pain of reflection which be disturb by the approach
of a beautiful child who come run into the recess i have choose with all the sportiveness of infancy
suddenly a i gaze on him an idea seize me that this little creature be unprejudiced and have live
too short a time to have imbibe a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him
a my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth

urge by this impulse i seize on the boy a he pass and draw him towards me as soon a he behold my
form he place his hand before his eye and utter a shrill scream i draw his hand forcibly from his
face and say child what be the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me

he struggle violently let me go he cry monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to piece
you be an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa

boy you will never see your father again you must come with me

hideous monster let me go my papa be a syndic he be m frankenstein he will punish you you dare not
keep me

frankenstein you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom i have swear eternal revenge you shall
be my first victim

the child still struggle and load me with epithet which carry despair to my heart i grasp his throat
to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my foot

i gaze on my victim and my heart swell with exultation and hellish triumph clap my hand i exclaim i
too can create desolation my enemy be not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a
thousand other misery shall torment and destroy him

a i fix my eye on the child i saw something glitter on his breast i take it it be a portrait of a
most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it soften and attract me for a few moment i gaze with
delight on her dark eye fringe by deep lash and her lovely lip but presently my rage return i
remember that i be for ever deprive of the delight that such beautiful creature could bestow and
that she whose resemblance i contemplate would in regard me have change that air of divine benignity
to one expressive of disgust and affright

can you wonder that such thought transport me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of
vent my sensation in exclamation and agony i do not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to
destroy them

while i be overcome by these feeling i leave the spot where i have commit the murder and seek a more
secluded hiding place i enter a barn which have appear to me to be empty a woman be sleep on some
straw she be young not indeed so beautiful a her whose portrait i hold but of an agreeable aspect
and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought be one of those whose joy impart
smile be bestow on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fair thy lover be near he
who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eye my beloved awake

the sleeper stir a thrill of terror run through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me
and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eye open and she behold me
the thought be madness it stir the fiend within me not i but she shall suffer the murder i have
commit because i be for ever rob of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime have it
source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lesson of felix and the sanguinary law of man i
have learn now to work mischief i bent over her and place the portrait securely in one of the fold
of her dress she move again and i flee

for some day i haunt the spot where these scene have take place sometimes wish to see you sometimes
resolve to quit the world and it misery for ever at length i wander towards these mountain and have
range through their immense recess consume by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may
not part until you have promise to comply with my requisition i be alone and miserable man will not
associate with me but one a deform and horrible a myself would not deny herself to me my companion
must be of the same specie and have the same defect this be you must create

chapter

the be finish speaking and fix his look upon me in the expectation of a reply but i be bewilder
perplexed and unable to arrange my idea sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
proposition he continue

you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathy necessary
for my be this you alone can do and i demand it of you a a right which you must not refuse to
concede

the latter part of his tale have kindle anew in me the anger that have die away while he narrate his
peaceful life among the cottager and a he say this i could no longer suppress the rage that burn
within me

i do refuse it i reply and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most
miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eye shall i create another like yourself
whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answer you you may torture me but i
will never consent

you be in the wrong reply the fiend and instead of threaten i be content to reason with you i be
malicious because i be miserable be i not shun and hat by all mankind you my creator would tear me
to piece and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pity me you would
not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice rift and destroy my frame the
work of your own hand shall i respect man when he condemn me let him live with me in the interchange
of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tear of gratitude at
his acceptance but that can not be the human sens be insurmountable barrier to our union yet mine
shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injury if i can not inspire love i
will cause fear and chiefly towards you my arch enemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable
hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that
you shall curse the hour of your birth

a fiendish rage animate him a he say this his face be wrinkle into contortion too horrible for human
eye to behold but presently he calm himself and proceed

i intend to reason this passion be detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you be the cause of
it excess if any be felt emotion of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a
hundredfold for that one creature sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in
dream of bliss that can not be realise what i ask of you be reasonable and moderate i demand a
creature of another sex but as hideous a myself the gratification be small but it be all that i can
receive and it shall content me it be true we shall be monster cut off from all the world but on
that account we shall be more attached to one another our life will not be happy but they will be
harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude
towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some exist thing do not deny me
my request

i be move i shudder when i thought of the possible consequence of my consent but i felt that there
be some justice in his argument his tale and the feeling he now express prove him to be a creature
of fine sensation and do i not a his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it be in my
power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continue

if you consent neither you nor any other human be shall ever see u again i will go to the vast wild
of south america my food be not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my
appetite acorn and berry afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature a
myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leave the sun will
shine on u a on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you be peaceful and human and
you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless a you have
be towards me i now see compassion in your eye let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you
to promise what i so ardently desire

you propose replied i to fly from the habitation of man to dwell in those wild where the beast of
the field will be your only companion how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man
persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their
detestation your evil passion will be renew and you will then have a companion to aid you in the
task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i can not consent

how inconstant be your feeling but a moment ago you be move by my representation and why do you
again harden yourself to my complaint i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that
make me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell a it may
chance in the most savage of place my evil passion will have flee for i shall meet with sympathy my
life will flow quietly away and in my die moment i shall not curse my maker

his word have a strange effect upon me i compassionate him and sometimes felt a wish to console him
but when i look upon him when i saw the filthy mass that move and talk my heart sicken and my
feeling be alter to those of horror and hatred i try to stifle these sensation i think that a i
could not sympathise with him i have no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness
which be yet in my power to bestow

you swear i say to be harmless but have you not already show a degree of malice that should
reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
afford a wider scope for your revenge

how be this i must not be trifle with and i demand an answer if i have no tie and no affection
hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crime and i
shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vice be the child of a forced
solitude that i abhor and my virtue will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i
shall feel the affection of a sensitive be and become link to the chain of existence and event from
which i be now exclude

i pause some time to reflect on all he have relate and the various argument which he have employ i
thought of the promise of virtue which he have display on the opening of his existence and the
subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protector have manifest
towards him his power and threat be not omit in my calculation a creature who could exist in the ice
cave of the glacier and hide himself from pursuit among the ridge of inaccessible precipice be a be
possessing faculty it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i conclude that
the justice due both to him and my fellow creature demand of me that i should comply with his
request turn to him therefore i say

i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the
neighbourhood of man as soon a i shall deliver into your hand a female who will accompany you in
your exile

i swear he cry by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burn my heart
that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and
commence your labour i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that
when you be ready i shall appear

say this he suddenly quit me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiment i saw him descend the
mountain with great speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lose among the undulation of the
sea of ice

his tale have occupy the whole day and the sun be upon the verge of the horizon when he depart i
know that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley a i should soon be encompass in darkness
but my heart be heavy and my step slow the labour of wind among the little path of the mountain and
fix my foot firmly a i advance perplexed me occupy a i be by the emotion which the occurrence of the
day have produce night be far advanced when i come to the halfway rest place and seat myself beside
the fountain the star shine at interval a the cloud pass from over them the dark pine rise before me
and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it be a scene of wonderful solemnity and
stir strange thought within me i weep bitterly and clasp my hand in agony i exclaim oh star and
cloud and wind ye be all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me
become a nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness

these be wild and miserable thought but i can not describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the
star weigh upon me and how i listen to every blast of wind a if it be a dull ugly siroc on it way to
consume me

morning dawn before i arrive at the village of chamounix i take no rest but return immediately to
geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensation they weigh on me with a
mountain weight and their excess destroy my agony beneath them thus i return home and enter the
house present myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awake intense alarm but i answer
no question scarcely do i speak i felt a if i be place under a ban a if i have no right to claim
their sympathy a if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i love them to
adoration and to save them i resolve to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of
such an occupation make every other circumstance of existence pas before me like a dream and that
think only have to me the reality of life

chapter

day after day week after week pass away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage
to recommence my work i fear the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i be unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which be enjoin me i find that i could not compose a female without again
devote several month to profound study and laborious disquisition i have hear of some discovery have
be make by an english philosopher the knowledge of which be material to my success and i sometimes
think of obtain my father consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of
delay and shrank from take the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity begin to
appear less absolute to me a change indeed have take place in me my health which have hitherto
decline be now much restore and my spirit when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rise
proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turn his thought towards the best
method of eradicate the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fit and
with a devour blackness overcast the approach sunshine at these moment i take refuge in the most
perfect solitude i pass whole day on the lake alone in a little boat watch the cloud and listening
to the rippling of the wave silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom fail to
restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i meet the salutation of my friend with a
readier smile and a more cheerful heart

it be after my return from one of these ramble that my father call me aside thus address me

i be happy to remark my dear son that you have resume your former pleasure and seem to be return to
yourself and yet you be still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i be lose in
conjecture a to the cause of this but yesterday an idea strike me and if it be well found i conjure
you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on u
all

i tremble violently at his exordium and my father continue

i confess my son that i have always look forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth a the tie
of our domestic comfort and the stay of my decline year you be attach to each other from your early
infancy you study together and appear in disposition and taste entirely suit to one another but so
blind be the experience of man that what i conceive to be the best assistant to my plan may have
entirely destroy it you perhaps regard her a your sister without any wish that she might become your
wife nay you may have meet with another whom you may love and consider yourself a bound in honour to
elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel

my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who
excite a elizabeth do my warm admiration and affection my future hope and prospect be entirely bind
up in the expectation of our union

the expression of your sentiment of this subject my dear victor give me more pleasure than i have
for some time experience if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present event may cast
a gloom over u but it be this gloom which appear to have take so strong a hold of your mind that i
wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage
we have be unfortunate and recent event have draw u from that everyday tranquillity befit my year
and infirmity you be young yet i do not suppose possess a you be of a competent fortune that an
early marriage would at all interfere with any future plan of honour and utility that you may have
form do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part
would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my word with candour and answer me i conjure you
with confidence and sincerity

i listen to my father in silence and remain for some time incapable of offer any reply i revolve
rapidly in my mind a multitude of thought and endeavour to arrive at some conclusion ala to me the
idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth be one of horror and dismay i be bind by a solemn
promise which i have not yet fulfil and dare not break or if i do what manifold misery might not
impend over me and my devote family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hang
round my neck and bow me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before i allow myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expect peace

i remember also the necessity impose upon me of either journey to england or enter into a long
correspondence with those philosopher of that country whose knowledge and discovery be of
indispensable use to me in my present undertake the latter method of obtain the desired intelligence
be dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i have an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engage
myself in my loathsome task in my father house while in habit of familiar intercourse with those i
love i know that a thousand fearful accident might occur the slight of which would disclose a tale
to thrill all connect with me with horror i be aware also that i should often lose all self command
all capacity of hide the harrowing sensation that would possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i love while thus employ once commence it would
quickly be achieve and i might be restore to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfil the
monster would depart for ever or so my fond fancy image some accident might meanwhile occur to
destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever

these feeling dictate my answer to my father i express a wish to visit england but conceal the true
reason of this request i clothe my desire under a guise which excite no suspicion while i urge my
desire with an earnestness that easily induce my father to comply after so long a period of an
absorb melancholy that resemble madness in it intensity and effect he be glad to find that i be
capable of take pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hop that change of scene and varied
amusement would before my return have restore me entirely to myself

the duration of my absence be leave to my own choice a few month or at most a year be the period
contemplate one paternal kind precaution he have take to ensure my have a companion without
previously communicate with me he have in concert with elizabeth arrange that clerval should join me
at strasburgh this interfere with the solitude i covet for the prosecution of my task yet at the
commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i
rejoice that thus i should be save many hour of lonely madden reflection nay henry might stand
between me and the intrusion of my foe if i be alone would he not at time force his abhorred
presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate it progress

to england therefore i be bind and it be understood that my union with elizabeth should take place
immediately on my return my father age render him extremely averse to delay for myself there be one
reward i promise myself from my detest toil one consolation for my unparalleled suffering it be the
prospect of that day when enfranchise from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget
the past in my union with her

i now make arrangement for my journey but one feeling haunt me which fill me with fear and agitation
during my absence i should leave my friend unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
unprotected from his attack exasperate a he might be by my departure but he have promise to follow
me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination be dreadful in
itself but soothe inasmuch a it suppose the safety of my friend i be agonise with the idea of the
possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i be the
slave of my creature i allow myself to be govern by the impulse of the moment and my present
sensation strongly intimate that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of
his machination

it be in the latter end of september that i again quit my native country my journey have be my own
suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she be fill with disquiet at the idea of my suffer
away from her the inroad of misery and grief it have be her care which provide me a companion in
clerval and yet a man be blind to a thousand minute circumstance which call forth a woman sedulous
attention she long to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflict emotion render her mute a she bid
me a tearful silent farewell

i throw myself into the carriage that be to convey me away hardly know whither i be go and careless
of what be pass around i remember only and it be with a bitter anguish that i reflect on it to order
that my chemical instrument should be pack to go with me fill with dreary imagination i pass through
many beautiful and majestic scene but my eye be fix and unobserving i could only think of the bourne
of my travel and the work which be to occupy me whilst they endure

after some day spend in listless indolence during which i traverse many league i arrive at
strasburgh where i wait two day for clerval he come alas how great be the contrast between u he be
alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauty of the setting sun and more happy when he
behold it rise and recommence a new day he point out to me the shift colour of the landscape and the
appearance of the sky this be what it be to live he cry now i enjoy existence but you my dear
frankenstein wherefore be you despond and sorrowful in truth i be occupy by gloomy thought and
neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflect in the rhine and you my
friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observe the scenery with an eye of
feeling and delight than in listen to my reflection i a miserable wretch haunt by a curse that shut
up every avenue to enjoyment

we have agree to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take
shipping for london during this voyage we pass many willowy island and saw several beautiful town we
stay a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrive at mainz the
course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descend rapidly and wind
between hill not high but steep and of beautiful form we saw many ruined castle stand on the edge of
precipice surround by black wood high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed present a
singularly variegate landscape in one spot you view rugged hill ruin castle overlook tremendous
precipice with the dark rhine rush beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourish vineyard
with green slop bank and a meandering river and populous town occupy the scene

we travel at the time of the vintage and hear the song of the labourer a we glide down the stream
even i depress in mind and my spirit continually agitate by gloomy feeling even i be pleased i lay
at the bottom of the boat and a i gaze on the cloudless blue sky i seem to drink in a tranquillity
to which i have long be a stranger and if these be my sensation who can describe those of henry he
felt a if he have be transport to fairy land and enjoy a happiness seldom taste by man i have see he
say the most beautiful scene of my own country i have visit the lake of lucerne and uri where the
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water cast black and impenetrable shade which
would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance be it not for the most verdant island that relieve the
eye by their gay appearance i have see this lake agitate by a tempest when the wind tear up
whirlwind of water and give you an idea of what the water spout must be on the great ocean and the
wave dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress be overwhelm by an
avalanche and where their dying voice be still say to be hear amid the pause of the nightly wind i
have see the mountain of la valais and the pay de vaud but this country victor please me more than
all those wonder the mountain of switzerland be more majestic and strange but there be a charm in
the bank of this divine river that i never before saw equal look at that castle which overhang yon
precipice and that also on the island almost conceal amongst the foliage of those lovely tree and
now that group of labourer come from among their vine and that village half hid in the recess of the
mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guard this place have a soul more in harmony with
man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peak of the mountain of our own
country

clerval beloved friend even now it delight me to record your word and to dwell on the praise of
which you be so eminently deserve he be a be form in the very poetry of nature his wild and
enthusiastic imagination be chasten by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflow with ardent
affection and his friendship be of that devote and wondrous nature that the worldly mind teach u to
look for only in the imagination but even human sympathy be not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind
the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he love with ardour

the sound cataract haunt him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood
their colour and their form be then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that have no need of a
remoter charm by thought supply or any interest unborrowd from the eye

wordsworth tintern abbey

and where do he now exist be this gentle and lovely be lose for ever have this mind so replete with
idea imagination fanciful and magnificent which form a world whose existence depend on the life of
it creator have this mind perish do it now only exist in my memory no it be not thus your form so
divinely wrought and beam with beauty have decay but your spirit still visit and console your
unhappy friend

pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual word be but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of
henry but they soothe my heart overflow with the anguish which his remembrance create i will proceed
with my tale

beyond cologne we descend to the plain of holland and we resolve to post the remainder of our way
for the wind be contrary and the stream of the river be too gentle to aid u

our journey here lose the interest arise from beautiful scenery but we arrive in a few day at
rotterdam whence we proceed by sea to england it be on a clear morning in the latter day of december
that i first saw the white cliff of britain the bank of the thames present a new scene they be flat
but fertile and almost every town be mark by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and
remember the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwich place which i have hear of even in my
country

at length we saw the numerous steeple of london st paul tower above all and the tower famed in
english history

chapter

london be our present point of rest we determine to remain several month in this wonderful and
celebrated city clerval desire the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourish at this
time but this be with me a secondary object i be principally occupy with the mean of obtain the
information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly avail myself of the letter of
introduction that i have bring with me address to the most distinguished natural philosopher

if this journey have take place during my day of study and happiness it would have afford me
inexpressible pleasure but a blight have come over my existence and i only visit these people for
the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest be so terribly
profound company be irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sight of heaven and earth
the voice of henry soothe me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy
uninteresting joyous face bring back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier place
between me and my fellow men this barrier be seal with the blood of william and justine and to
reflect on the event connect with those name fill my soul with anguish

but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he be inquisitive and anxious to gain experience
and instruction the difference of manner which he observe be to him an inexhaustible source of
instruction and amusement he be also pursue an object he have long have in view his design be to
visit india in the belief that he have in his knowledge of it various language and in the view he
have take of it society the mean of materially assist the progress of european colonization and
trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he be for ever busy and the only
check to his enjoyment be my sorrowful and dejected mind i try to conceal this as much a possible
that i might not debar him from the pleasure natural to one who be enter on a new scene of life
undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refuse to accompany him allege another
engagement that i might remain alone i now also begin to collect the material necessary for my new
creation and this be to me like the torture of single drop of water continually fall on the head
every thought that be devote to it be an extreme anguish and every word that i speak in allusion to
it cause my lip to quiver and my heart to palpitate

after pass some month in london we receive a letter from a person in scotland who have formerly be
our visitor at geneva he mention the beauty of his native country and ask u if those be not
sufficient allurement to induce u to prolong our journey a far north a perth where he reside clerval
eagerly desire to accept this invitation and i although i abhor society wish to view again mountain
and stream and all the wondrous work with which nature adorn her chosen dwelling place

we have arrive in england at the beginning of october and it be now february we accordingly
determine to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this
expedition we do not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford
matlock and the cumberland lakes resolve to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of
july i pack up my chemical instrument and the material i have collect resolve to finish my labour in
some obscure nook in the northern highland of scotland

we quit london on the of march and remain a few day at windsor ramble in it beautiful forest this be
a new scene to u mountaineer the majestic oak the quantity of game and the herd of stately deer be
all novelty to u

from thence we proceed to oxford a we enter this city our mind be fill with the remembrance of the
event that have be transact there more than a century and a half before it be here that charles i
have collect his force this city have remain faithful to him after the whole nation have forsake his
cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his
companion the amiable falkland the insolent gore his queen and son give a peculiar interest to every
part of the city which they might be suppose to have inhabit the spirit of elder day find a dwelling
here and we delight to trace it footstep if these feeling have not find an imaginary gratification
the appearance of the city have yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the college
be ancient and picturesque the street be almost magnificent and the lovely isi which flow beside it
through meadow of exquisite verdure be spread forth into a placid expanse of water which reflect it
majestic assemblage of tower and spire and dome embosomed among aged tree

i enjoy this scene and yet my enjoyment be embitter both by the memory of the past and the
anticipation of the future i be form for peaceful happiness during my youthful day discontent never
visit my mind and if i be ever overcome by ennui the sight of what be beautiful in nature or the
study of what be excellent and sublime in the production of man could always interest my heart and
communicate elasticity to my spirit but i be a blasted tree the bolt have enter my soul and i felt
then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to be a miserable spectacle of wrecked
humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself

we pass a considerable period at oxford rambling among it environs and endeavour to identify every
spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyage of
discovery be often prolong by the successive object that present themselves we visit the tomb of the
illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul be elevate from it
debasing and miserable fear to contemplate the divine idea of liberty and self sacrifice of which
these sight be the monument and the remembrancers for an instant i dare to shake off my chain and
look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron have eat into my flesh and i sank again
tremble and hopeless into my miserable self

we leave oxford with regret and proceed to matlock which be our next place of rest the country in
the neighbourhood of this village resemble to a great degree the scenery of switzerland but
everything be on a low scale and the green hill want the crown of distant white alp which always
attend on the piny mountain of my native country we visit the wondrous cave and the little cabinet
of natural history where the curiosity be dispose in the same manner a in the collection at servox
and chamounix the latter name make me tremble when pronounce by henry and i hasten to quit matlock
with which that terrible scene be thus associate

from derby still journey northward we pass two month in cumberland and westmorland i could now
almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patch of snow which yet linger on the
northern side of the mountain the lake and the dashing of the rocky stream be all familiar and dear
sight to me here also we make some acquaintance who almost contrive to cheat me into happiness the
delight of clerval be proportionably great than mine his mind expand in the company of men of talent
and he find in his own nature great capacity and resource than he could have imagine himself to have
possess while he associate with his inferior i could pass my life here say he to me and among these
mountain i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine

but he find that a traveller life be one that include much pain amidst it enjoyment his feeling be
for ever on the stretch and when he begin to sink into repose he find himself oblige to quit that on
which he rest in pleasure for something new which again engage his attention and which also he
forsake for other novelty

we have scarcely visit the various lake of cumberland and westmorland and conceive an affection for
some of the inhabitant when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approach and we
leave them to travel on for my own part i be not sorry i have now neglect my promise for some time
and i fear the effect of the dmons disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his
vengeance on my relative this idea pursue me and torment me at every moment from which i might
otherwise have snatch repose and peace i wait for my letter with feverish impatience if they be
delay i be miserable and overcome by a thousand fear and when they arrive and i saw the
superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dare to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i
think that the fiend follow me and might expedite my remissness by murder my companion when these
thought possess me i would not quit henry for a moment but follow him a his shadow to protect him
from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt a if i have commit some great crime the consciousness
of which haunt me i be guiltless but i have indeed draw down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal
a that of crime

i visit edinburgh with languid eye and mind and yet that city might have interest the most
unfortunate be clerval do not like it so well a oxford for the antiquity of the latter city be more
pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh it romantic castle and it
environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st bernard well and the pentland hill
compensate him for the change and fill him with cheerfulness and admiration but i be impatient to
arrive at the termination of my journey

we leave edinburgh in a week pass through coupar st andrew and along the bank of the tay to perth
where our friend expect u but i be in no mood to laugh and talk with stranger or enter into their
feeling or plan with the good humour expect from a guest and accordingly i tell clerval that i wish
to make the tour of scotland alone do you say i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may
be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motion i entreat you leave me to peace and
solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a light heart more congenial to
your own temper

henry wish to dissuade me but see me bent on this plan cease to remonstrate he entreat me to write
often i have rather be with you he say in your solitary ramble than with these scotch people whom i
do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which
i can not do in your absence

have part from my friend i determine to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in
solitude i do not doubt but that the monster follow me and would discover himself to me when i
should have finish that he might receive his companion

with this resolution i traverse the northern highland and fix on one of the remotest of the orkneys
a the scene of my labour it be a place fit for such a work be hardly more than a rock whose high
side be continually beat upon by the wave the soil be barren scarcely afford pasture for a few
miserable cow and oatmeal for it inhabitant which consist of five person whose gaunt and scraggy
limb give token of their miserable fare vegetable and bread when they indulge in such luxury and
even fresh water be to be procure from the mainland which be about five mile distant

on the whole island there be but three miserable hut and one of these be vacant when i arrive this i
hire it contain but two room and these exhibit all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the
thatch have fall in the wall be unplastered and the door be off it hinge i order it to be repair buy
some furniture and take possession an incident which would doubtless have occasion some surprise
have not all the sens of the cottager be benumb by want and squalid poverty a it be i live ungazed
at and unmolested hardly thank for the pittance of food and clothes which i give so much do suffer
blunt even the coarse sensation of men

in this retreat i devote the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permit i walk on
the stony beach of the sea to listen to the wave a they roar and dash at my foot it be a monotonous
yet ever change scene i thought of switzerland it be far different from this desolate and appalling
landscape it hill be cover with vine and it cottage be scattered thickly in the plain it fair lake
reflect a blue and gentle sky and when trouble by the wind their tumult be but a the play of a
lively infant when compare to the roaring of the giant ocean

in this manner i distribute my occupation when i first arrive but a i proceed in my labour it become
every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several day and at other time i toil day and night in order to complete my work it be
indeed a filthy process in which i be engage during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic
frenzy have blind me to the horror of my employment my mind be intently fix on the consummation of
my labour and my eye be shut to the horror of my proceeding but now i go to it in cold blood and my
heart often sicken at the work of my hand

thus situate employ in the most detestable occupation immerse in a solitude where nothing could for
an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i be engage my spirit become unequal i
grow restless and nervous every moment i fear to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eye fix
on the ground fear to raise them l they should encounter the object which i so much dread to behold
i fear to wander from the sight of my fellow creature l when alone he should come to claim his
companion

in the mean time i work on and my labour be already considerably advance i look towards it
completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dare not trust myself to question but which be
intermix with obscure foreboding of evil that make my heart sicken in my bosom

chapter

i sit one evening in my laboratory the sun have set and the moon be just rise from the sea i have
not sufficient light for my employment and i remain idle in a pause of consideration of whether i
should leave my labour for the night or hasten it conclusion by an unremitting attention to it a i
sit a train of reflection occur to me which lead me to consider the effect of what i be now do three
year before i be engage in the same manner and have create a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity have
desolate my heart and fill it for ever with the bitter remorse i be now about to form another be of
whose disposition i be alike ignorant she might become ten thousand time more malignant than her
mate and delight for it own sake in murder and wretchedness he have swear to quit the neighbourhood
of man and hide himself in desert but she have not and she who in all probability be to become a
thinking and reason animal might refuse to comply with a compact make before her creation they might
even hate each other the creature who already live loathe his own deformity and might he not
conceive a great abhorrence for it when it come before his eye in the female form she also might
turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone
exasperate by the fresh provocation of be desert by one of his own specie

even if they be to leave europe and inhabit the desert of the new world yet one of the first result
of those sympathy for which the dmon thirst would be child and a race of devil would be propagate
upon the earth who might make the very existence of the specie of man a condition precarious and
full of terror have i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generation i
have before be move by the sophism of the be i have create i have be strike senseless by his
fiendish threat but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shudder to
think that future age might curse me a their pest whose selfishness have not hesitate to buy it own
peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race

i tremble and my heart fail within me when on look up i saw by the light of the moon the dmon at the
casement a ghastly grin wrinkle his lip a he gaze on me where i sit fulfil the task which he have
allot to me yes he have follow me in my travel he have loiter in forest hide himself in cave or take
refuge in wide and desert heath and he now come to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my
promise

a i look on him his countenance express the utmost extent of malice and treachery i think with a
sensation of madness on my promise of create another like to him and tremble with passion tore to
piece the thing on which i be engage the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future
existence he depend for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew

i leave the room and lock the door make a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labour and
then with tremble step i seek my own apartment i be alone none be near me to dissipate the gloom and
relieve me from the sicken oppression of the most terrible revery

several hour pass and i remain near my window gaze on the sea it be almost motionless for the wind
be hush and all nature repose under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessel alone speck the
water and now and then the gentle breeze waft the sound of voice a the fisherman call to one another
i felt the silence although i be hardly conscious of it extreme profundity until my ear be suddenly
arrest by the paddling of oar near the shore and a person land close to my house

in a few minute after i hear the creaking of my door a if some one endeavour to open it softly i
tremble from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it be and wish to rouse one of the peasant
who dwell in a cottage not far from mine but i be overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often
felt in frightful dream when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and be root to
the spot

presently i hear the sound of footstep along the passage the door open and the wretch whom i dread
appear shut the door he approach me and say in a smothered voice

you have destroy the work which you begin what be it that you intend do you dare to break your
promise i have endure toil and misery i leave switzerland with you i creep along the shore of the
rhine among it willow island and over the summit of it hill i have dwell many month in the heath of
england and among the desert of scotland i have endure incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do
you dare destroy my hope

begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and
wickedness

slave i before reason with you but you have prove yourself unworthy of my condescension remember
that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of
day will be hateful to you you be my creator but i be your master obey

the hour of my irresolution be past and the period of your power be arrive your threat can not move
me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not create you a companion
in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dmon whose delight be in death and
wretchedness begone i be firm and your word will only exasperate my rage

the monster saw my determination in my face and gnash his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each
man cry he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i have feeling of
affection and they be requite by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hour will
pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
ever be you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other
passion but revenge remain revenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my
tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gaze on your misery beware for i be fearless and
therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with it venom man you
shall repent of the injury you inflict

devil cease and do not poison the air with these sound of malice i have declare my resolution to you
and i be no coward to bend beneath word leave me i be inexorable

it be well i go but remember i shall be with you on your wedding night

i start forward and exclaim villain before you sign my death warrant be sure that you be yourself
safe

i would have seize him but he elude me and quit the house with precipitation in a few moment i saw
him in his boat which shot across the water with an arrowy swiftness and be soon lose amidst the
wave

all be again silent but his word rang in my ear i burn with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace
and precipitate him into the ocean i walk up and down my room hastily and perturb while my
imagination conjure up a thousand image to torment and sting me why have i not follow him and close
with him in mortal strife but i have suffer him to depart and he have direct his course towards the
mainland i shudder to think who might be the next victim sacrifice to his insatiate revenge and then
i think again of his word i will be with you on your wedding night that then be the period fix for
the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice
the prospect do not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tear and
endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatch from her tear the first i have
shed for many month stream from my eye and i resolve not to fall before my enemy without a bitter
struggle

the night pass away and the sun rise from the ocean my feeling become calm if it may be call
calmness when the violence of rage sink into the depth of despair i leave the house the horrid scene
of the last night contention and walk on the beach of the sea which i almost regard a an insuperable
barrier between me and my fellow creature nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me
i desire that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it be true but uninterrupted by any
sudden shock of misery if i return it be to be sacrifice or to see those whom i most loved die under
the grasp of a dmon whom i have myself create

i walk about the isle like a restless spectre separate from all it love and miserable in the
separation when it become noon and the sun rise high i lay down on the grass and be overpower by a
deep sleep i have be awake the whole of the precede night my nerve be agitate and my eye inflame by
watch and misery the sleep into which i now sink refresh me and when i awake i again felt a if i
belong to a race of human being like myself and i begin to reflect upon what have pass with great
composure yet still the word of the fiend rang in my ear like a death knell they appear like a dream
yet distinct and oppressive a a reality

the sun have far descend and i still sit on the shore satisfy my appetite which have become ravenous
with an oaten cake when i saw a fishing boat land close to me and one of the men bring me a packet
it contain letter from geneva and one from clerval entreat me to join him he say that he be wear
away his time fruitlessly where he be that letter from the friend he have form in london desire his
return to complete the negotiation they have enter into for his indian enterprise he could not any
longer delay his departure but a his journey to london might be follow even sooner than he now
conjecture by his long voyage he entreat me to bestow a much of my society on him a i could spare he
beseech me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed
southward together this letter in a degree recall me to life and i determine to quit my island at
the expiration of two day

yet before i depart there be a task to perform on which i shudder to reflect i must pack up my
chemical instrument and for that purpose i must enter the room which have be the scene of my odious
work and i must handle those utensil the sight of which be sicken to me the next morning at daybreak
i summon sufficient courage and unlock the door of my laboratory the remains of the half finished
creature whom i have destroy lay scatter on the floor and i almost felt a if i have mangle the
living flesh of a human be i pause to collect myself and then enter the chamber with tremble hand i
convey the instrument out of the room but i reflect that i ought not to leave the relic of my work
to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasant and i accordingly put them into a basket with a
great quantity of stone and lay them up determine to throw them into the sea that very night and in
the meantime i sit upon the beach employ in cleaning and arrange my chemical apparatus

nothing could be more complete than the alteration that have take place in my feeling since the
night of the appearance of the dmon i have before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair a a
thing that with whatever consequence must be fulfil but i now felt a if a film have be take from
before my eye and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renew my labour do not for one
instant occur to me the threat i have hear weigh on my thought but i do not reflect that a voluntary
act of mine could avert it i have resolve in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i
have first make would be an act of the base and most atrocious selfishness and i banish from my mind
every thought that could lead to a different conclusion

between two and three in the morning the moon rise and i then put my basket aboard a little skiff
sail out about four mile from the shore the scene be perfectly solitary a few boat be return towards
land but i sail away from them i felt a if i be about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoid
with shudder anxiety any encounter with my fellow creature at one time the moon which have before be
clear be suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i take advantage of the moment of darkness and
cast my basket into the sea i listen to the gurgle sound a it sink and then sail away from the spot
the sky become clouded but the air be pure although chill by the northeast breeze that be then rise
but it refresh me and fill me with such agreeable sensation that i resolve to prolong my stay on the
water and fix the rudder in a direct position stretch myself at the bottom of the boat cloud hide
the moon everything be obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat a it keel cut through the wave
the murmur lull me and in a short time i sleep soundly

i do not know how long i remain in this situation but when i awake i find that the sun have already
mount considerably the wind be high and the wave continually threaten the safety of my little skiff
i find that the wind be northeast and must have drive me far from the coast from which i have embark
i endeavour to change my course but quickly find that if i again make the attempt the boat would be
instantly fill with water thus situate my only resource be to drive before the wind i confess that i
felt a few sensation of terror i have no compass with me and be so slenderly acquaint with the
geography of this part of the world that the sun be of little benefit to me i might be drive into
the wide atlantic and feel all the torture of starvation or be swallow up in the immeasurable water
that roar and buffet around me i have already be out many hour and felt the torment of a burning
thirst a prelude to my other suffering i look on the heaven which be cover by cloud that fly before
the wind only to be replace by others i look upon the sea it be to be my grave fiend i exclaim your
task be already fulfil i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clerval all leave behind on whom
the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passion this idea plunge me into a reverie so
despairing and frightful that even now when the scene be on the point of closing before me for ever
i shudder to reflect on it

some hour pass thus but by degree a the sun decline towards the horizon the wind die away into a
gentle breeze and the sea become free from breaker but these give place to a heavy swell i felt sick
and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south

almost spent a i be by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endure for several hour this sudden
certainty of life rush like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tear gush from my eye

how mutable be our feeling and how strange be that cling love we have of life even in the excess of
misery i construct another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steer my course towards the land
it have a wild and rocky appearance but a i approach nearer i easily perceive the trace of
cultivation i saw vessel near the shore and find myself suddenly transport back to the neighbourhood
of civilised man i carefully trace the winding of the land and hail a steeple which i at length saw
issue from behind a small promontory a i be in a state of extreme debility i resolve to sail
directly towards the town a a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i have
money with me a i turn the promontory i perceive a small neat town and a good harbour which i enter
my heart bound with joy at my unexpected escape

a i be occupy in fix the boat and arrange the sails several people crowd towards the spot they seem
much surprise at my appearance but instead of offer me any assistance whisper together with gesture
that at any other time might have produce in me a slight sensation of alarm a it be i merely remark
that they speak english and i therefore address them in that language my good friend say i will you
be so kind a to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i be

you will know that soon enough reply a man with a hoarse voice maybe you be come to a place that
will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consult a to your quarter i promise you

i be exceedingly surprise on receive so rude an answer from a stranger and i be also disconcert on
perceive the frowning and angry countenance of his companion why do you answer me so roughly i reply
surely it be not the custom of englishman to receive stranger so inhospitably

i do not know say the man what the custom of the english may be but it be the custom of the irish to
hate villain

while this strange dialogue continue i perceive the crowd rapidly increase their face express a
mixture of curiosity and anger which annoy and in some degree alarm me i inquire the way to the inn
but no one reply i then move forward and a murmuring sound arise from the crowd a they follow and
surround me when an ill look man approach tap me on the shoulder and say come sir you must follow me
to mr kirwins to give an account of yourself

who be mr kirwin why be i to give an account of myself be not this a free country

ay sir free enough for honest folk mr kirwin be a magistrate and you be to give an account of the
death of a gentleman who be find murder here last night

this answer startle me but i presently recover myself i be innocent that could easily be prove
accordingly i follow my conductor in silence and be lead to one of the best house in the town i be
ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but be surround by a crowd i think it politic to rouse all my
strength that no physical debility might be construe into apprehension or conscious guilt little do
i then expect the calamity that be in a few moment to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and
despair all fear of ignominy or death

i must pause here for it require all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful event which
i be about to relate in proper detail to my recollection

chapter

i be soon introduce into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild
manner he look upon me however with some degree of severity and then turn towards my conductor he
ask who appear a witness on this occasion

about half a dozen men come forward and one be select by the magistrate he depose that he have be
out fish the night before with his son and brother in law daniel nugent when about ten oclock they
observe a strong northerly blast rise and they accordingly put in for port it be a very dark night a
the moon have not yet rise they do not land at the harbour but a they have be accustom at a creek
about two mile below he walk on first carry a part of the fishing tackle and his companion follow
him at some distance a he be proceed along the sand he strike his foot against something and fell at
his length on the ground his companion come up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they
find that he have fall on the body of a man who be to all appearance dead their first supposition be
that it be the corpse of some person who have be drown and be throw on shore by the wave but on
examination they find that the clothes be not wet and even that the body be not then cold they
instantly carry it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavour but in vain to restore
it to life it appear to be a handsome young man about five and twenty year of age he have apparently
be strangle for there be no sign of any violence except the black mark of finger on his neck

the first part of this deposition do not in the least interest me but when the mark of the finger be
mention i remember the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitate my limb tremble and a
mist come over my eye which oblige me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observe me with
a keen eye and of course draw an unfavourable augury from my manner

the son confirm his father account but when daniel nugent be call he swear positively that just
before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the
shore and as far a he could judge by the light of a few star it be the same boat in which i have
just land

a woman depose that she live near the beach and be stand at the door of her cottage wait for the
return of the fisherman about an hour before she hear of the discovery of the body when she saw a
boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse be afterwards
find

another woman confirm the account of the fisherman have bring the body into her house it be not cold
they put it into a bed and rub it and daniel go to the town for an apothecary but life be quite go

several other men be examine concern my landing and they agree that with the strong north wind that
have arise during the night it be very probable that i have beat about for many hour and have be
oblige to return nearly to the same spot from which i have depart besides they observe that it
appear that i have bring the body from another place and it be likely that a i do not appear to know
the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place
where i have deposit the corpse

mr kirwin on hear this evidence desire that i should be take into the room where the body lay for
interment that it might be observe what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea be
probably suggest by the extreme agitation i have exhibit when the mode of the murder have be
describe i be accordingly conduct by the magistrate and several other person to the inn i could not
help be strike by the strange coincidence that have take place during this eventful night but know
that i have be converse with several person in the island i have inhabit about the time that the
body have be find i be perfectly tranquil a to the consequence of the affair

i enter the room where the corpse lay and be lead up to the coffin how can i describe my sensation
on behold it i feel yet parch with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shudder
and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witness pass like a dream from my
memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretch before me i gasp for breath and throw
myself on the body i exclaim have my murderous machination deprive you also my dear henry of life
two i have already destroy other victim await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor

the human frame could no longer support the agony that i endure and i be carry out of the room in
strong convulsion

a fever succeed to this i lay for two month on the point of death my raving a i afterwards hear be
frightful i call myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my
attendant to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i be torment and at others i felt the
finger of the monster already grasp my neck and scream aloud with agony and terror fortunately a i
speak my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gesture and bitter cry be sufficient
to affright the other witness

why do i not die more miserable than man ever be before why do i not sink into forgetfulness and
rest death snatch away many bloom child the only hope of their doting parent how many bride and
youthful lover have be one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worm and the
decay of the tomb of what material be i make that i could thus resist so many shock which like the
turning of the wheel continually renew the torture

but i be doom to live and in two month find myself a awake from a dream in a prison stretch on a
wretched bed surround by gaoler turnkey bolt and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it be
morning i remember when i thus awake to understand i have forget the particular of what have happen
and only felt a if some great misfortune have suddenly overwhelm me but when i look around and saw
the barred window and the squalidness of the room in which i be all flash across my memory and i
groan bitterly

this sound disturb an old woman who be sleep in a chair beside me she be a hired nurse the wife of
one of the turnkey and her countenance express all those bad quality which often characterise that
class the line of her face be hard and rude like that of person accustom to see without sympathise
in sight of misery her tone express her entire indifference she address me in english and the voice
strike me a one that i have hear during my suffering

be you good now sir say she

i reply in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i be but if it be all true if indeed i do
not dream i be sorry that i be still alive to feel this misery and horror

for that matter reply the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murder i believe that it be
good for you if you be dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business i
be send to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it be well if everybody do
the same

i turn with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just save on
the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that have pass the whole
series of my life appear to me a a dream i sometimes doubt if indeed it be all true for it never
present itself to my mind with the force of reality

a the image that float before me become more distinct i grow feverish a darkness press around me no
one be near me who soothe me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand support me the physician
come and prescribed medicine and the old woman prepare them for me but utter carelessness be visible
in the first and the expression of brutality be strongly mark in the visage of the second who could
be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee

these be my first reflection but i soon learn that mr kirwin have show me extreme kindness he have
cause the best room in the prison to be prepare for me wretched indeed be the best and it be he who
have provide a physician and a nurse it be true he seldom come to see me for although he ardently
desire to relieve the suffering of every human creature he do not wish to be present at the agony
and miserable raving of a murderer he come therefore sometimes to see that i be not neglect but his
visit be short and with long interval

one day while i be gradually recover i be seat in a chair my eye half open and my cheek livid like
those in death i be overcome by gloom and misery and often reflect i have well seek death than
desire to remain in a world which to me be replete with wretchedness at one time i consider whether
i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine
have be such be my thought when the door of my apartment be open and mr kirwin enter his countenance
express sympathy and compassion he draw a chair close to mine and address me in french

i fear that this place be very shock to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable

i thank you but all that you mention be nothing to me on the whole earth there be no comfort which i
be capable of receive

i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down a you be by so
strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can
easily be bring to free you from the criminal charge

that be my least concern i be by a course of strange event become the most miserable of mortal
persecute and torture a i be and have be can death be any evil to me

nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonise than the strange chance that have lately occur
you be throw by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for it hospitality seize immediately
and charge with murder the first sight that be present to your eye be the body of your friend murder
in so unaccountable a manner and place a it be by some fiend across your path

a mr kirwin say this notwithstanding the agitation i endure on this retrospect of my suffering i
also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seem to possess concern me i suppose some
astonishment be exhibit in my countenance for mr kirwin hasten to say

immediately upon your be take ill all the paper that be on your person be bring me and i examine
them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relation an account of your
misfortune and illness i find several letter and among others one which i discover from it
commencement to be from your father i instantly write to geneva nearly two month have elapse since
the departure of my letter but you be ill even now you tremble you be unfit for agitation of any
kind

this suspense be a thousand time bad than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death
have be act and whose murder i be now to lament

your family be perfectly well say mr kirwin with gentleness and someone a friend be come to visit
you

i know not by what chain of think the idea present itself but it instantly dart into my mind that
the murderer have come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval a a new
incitement for me to comply with his hellish desire i put my hand before my eye and cry out in agony

oh take him away i can not see him for god sake do not let him enter

mr kirwin regard me with a troubled countenance he could not help regard my exclamation a a
presumption of my guilt and say in rather a severe tone

i should have think young man that the presence of your father would have be welcome instead of
inspire such violent repugnance

my father cry i while every feature and every muscle be relax from anguish to pleasure be my father
indeed come how kind how very kind but where be he why do he not hasten to me

my change of manner surprised and please the magistrate perhaps he think that my former exclamation
be a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resume his former benevolence he rise and
quit the room with my nurse and in a moment my father enter it

nothing at this moment could have give me great pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretch out
my hand to him and cry

be you then safe and elizabeth and ernest

my father calm me with assurance of their welfare and endeavour by dwell on these subject so
interest to my heart to raise my despond spirit but he soon felt that a prison can not be the abode
of cheerfulness what a place be this that you inhabit my son say he look mournfully at the barred
window and wretched appearance of the room you travel to seek happiness but a fatality seem to
pursue you and poor clerval

the name of my unfortunate and murder friend be an agitation too great to be endure in my weak state
i shed tear

ala yes my father reply i some destiny of the most horrible kind hang over me and i must live to
fulfil it or surely i should have die on the coffin of henry

we be not allow to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health render
every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin come in and insist that my
strength should not be exhaust by too much exertion but the appearance of my father be to me like
that of my good angel and i gradually recover my health

a my sickness quit me i be absorb by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the
image of clerval be for ever before me ghastly and murder more than once the agitation into which
these reflection throw me make my friend dread a dangerous relapse ala why do they preserve so
miserable and detest a life it be surely that i might fulfil my destiny which be now draw to a close
soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbing and relieve me from the mighty weight of
anguish that bear me to the dust and in execute the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then
the appearance of death be distant although the wish be ever present to my thought and i often sit
for hour motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my
destroyer in it ruin

the season of the assize approach i have already be three month in prison and although i be still
weak and in continual danger of a relapse i be oblige to travel nearly a hundred mile to the country
town where the court be hold mr kirwin charge himself with every care of collect witness and arrange
my defence i be spar the disgrace of appear publicly a a criminal a the case be not bring before the
court that decide on life and death the grand jury reject the bill on it be prove that i be on the
orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend be find and a fortnight after my removal i be
liberate from prison

my father be enrapture on find me free from the vexation of a criminal charge that i be again allow
to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permit to return to my native country i do not participate in
these feeling for to me the wall of a dungeon or a palace be alike hateful the cup of life be poison
for ever and although the sun shone upon me a upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me
nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrate by no light but the glimmer of two eye that
glare upon me sometimes they be the expressive eye of henry languish in death the dark orb nearly
cover by the lid and the long black lash that fringe them sometimes it be the watery cloud eye of
the monster a i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt

my father try to awaken in me the feeling of affection he talk of geneva which i should soon visit
of elizabeth and ernest but these word only draw deep groan from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish
for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or long with a devouring
maladie du pay to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that have be so dear to me in early
childhood but my general state of feeling be a torpor in which a prison be a welcome a residence a
the divine scene in nature and these fit be seldom interrupt but by paroxysm of anguish and despair
at these moment i often endeavour to put an end to the existence i loathe and it require unceasing
attendance and vigilance to restrain me from commit some dreadful act of violence

yet one duty remain to me the recollection of which finally triumph over my selfish despair it be
necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the life of those i so
fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance lead me to the place of his
concealment or if he dare again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to
the existence of the monstrous image which i have endue with the mockery of a soul still more
monstrous my father still desire to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigue
of a journey for i be a shattered wreck the shadow of a human be my strength be go i be a mere
skeleton and fever night and day prey upon my wasted frame

still a i urge our leave ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father think it best to
yield we take our passage on board a vessel bound for havre de grace and sail with a fair wind from
the irish shore it be midnight i lay on the deck look at the star and listen to the dashing of the
wave i hail the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when
i reflect that i should soon see geneva the past appear to me in the light of a frightful dream yet
the vessel in which i be the wind that blow me from the detest shore of ireland and the sea which
surround me tell me too forcibly that i be deceive by no vision and that clerval my friend and dear
companion have fall a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole
life my quiet happiness while reside with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my
departure for ingolstadt i remember shudder the mad enthusiasm that hurry me on to the creation of
my hideous enemy and i call to mind the night in which he first live i be unable to pursue the train
of thought a thousand feeling press upon me and i weep bitterly

ever since my recovery from the fever i have be in the custom of take every night a small quantity
of laudanum for it be by mean of this drug only that i be enable to gain the rest necessary for the
preservation of life oppress by the recollection of my various misfortune i now swallow double my
usual quantity and soon sleep profoundly but sleep do not afford me respite from thought and misery
my dream present a thousand object that scar me towards morning i be possess by a kind of nightmare
i felt the fiend grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groan and cry ring in my ear my
father who be watch over me perceive my restlessness awake me the dash wave be around the cloudy sky
above the fiend be not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce be establish between the
present hour and the irresistible disastrous future impart to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of
which the human mind be by it structure peculiarly susceptible

chapter

the voyage come to an end we land and proceed to paris i soon find that i have overtax my strength
and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my father care and attention be
indefatigable but he do not know the origin of my suffering and seek erroneous method to remedy the
incurable ill he wish me to seek amusement in society i abhor the face of man oh not abhor they be
my brother my fellow being and i felt attract even to the most repulsive among them a to creature of
an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i have no right to share their intercourse
i have unchain an enemy among them whose joy it be to shed their blood and to revel in their groan
how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world do they know my unhallowed act and
the crime which have their source in me

my father yield at length to my desire to avoid society and strive by various argument to banish my
despair sometimes he think that i felt deeply the degradation of be oblige to answer a charge of
murder and he endeavour to prove to me the futility of pride

ala my father say i how little do you know me human being their feeling and passion would indeed be
degrade if such a wretch a i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine be as innocent a i and she
suffer the same charge she die for it and i be the cause of this i murder her william justine and
henry they all die by my hand

my father have often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accuse
myself he sometimes seem to desire an explanation and at others he appear to consider it a the
offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind have present itself to my
imagination the remembrance of which i preserve in my convalescence i avoid explanation and maintain
a continual silence concern the wretch i have create i have a persuasion that i should be suppose
mad and this in itself would for ever have chain my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to
disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror
the inmate of his breast i check therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and be silent when i
would have give the world to have confide the fatal secret yet still word like those i have record
would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part
relieve the burden of my mysterious woe

upon this occasion my father say with an expression of unbounded wonder my dear victor what
infatuation be this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again

i be not mad i cry energetically the sun and the heaven who have view my operation can bear witness
of my truth i be the assassin of those most innocent victim they die by my machination a thousand
time would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have save their life but i could not my father
indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race

the conclusion of this speech convince my father that my idea be derange and he instantly change the
subject of our conversation and endeavour to alter the course of my thought he wish as much a
possible to obliterate the memory of the scene that have take place in ireland and never allude to
them or suffer me to speak of my misfortune

a time pass away i become more calm misery have her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talk in the
same incoherent manner of my own crime sufficient for me be the consciousness of them by the utmost
self violence i curb the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desire to declare itself to
the whole world and my manner be calm and more compose than they have ever be since my journey to
the sea of ice

a few day before we leave paris on our way to switzerland i receive the following letter from
elizabeth

my dear friend

it give me the great pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle date at paris you be no longer at a
formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you

be pass most miserably torture a i have be by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your
countenance and to find that your heart be not totally void of comfort and tranquillity

yet i fear that the same feeling now exist that make you so miserable a year ago even perhaps
augment by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortune weigh upon you but a
conversation that i have with my uncle previous to his departure render some explanation necessary
before we meet

explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my
question be answer and all my doubt satisfy but you be distant from me and it be possible that you
may dread and yet be please with this explanation and in a probability of this be the case i dare
not any long postpone write what during your absence i have often wish to express to you but have
never have the courage to begin

you well know victor that our union have be the favourite plan of your parent ever since our infancy
we be tell this when young and taught to look forward to it a an event that would certainly take
place we be affectionate playfellow during childhood and i believe dear and value friend to one

without desire a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dear victor answer me i
conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truth do you not love another

you have travel you have spend several year of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my
friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy fly to solitude from the society of every creature
i could not help suppose that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bind in honour to
fulfil the wish of your parent although they oppose themselves to your inclination but this be false
reason i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dream of futurity you have be
my constant friend and companion but it be your happiness i desire as well a my own when i declare
to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it be the dictate of your own
free choice even now i weep to think that borne down a you be by the cruellest misfortune you may
stifle by the word honour all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to
yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your misery tenfold by be an
obstacle to your wish ah victor be assure that your cousin and playmate have too sincere a love for
you not to be make miserable by this supposition be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one
request remain satisfy that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity

it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your
lip when we meet occasion by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness

elizabeth lavenza

geneva may

this letter revive in my memory what i have before forget the threat of the fiend i will be with you
on your wed night such be my sentence and on that night would the dmon employ every art to destroy
me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promise partly to console my suffering on that
night he have determine to consummate his crime by my death well be it so a deadly struggle would
then assuredly take place in which if he be victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be
at an end if he be vanquish i should be a free man alas what freedom such a the peasant enjoy when
his family have be massacre before his eye his cottage burn his land lay waste and he be turned
adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i
possess a treasure ala balance by those horror of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until
death

sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feeling steal into my
heart and dare to whisper paradisiacal dream of love and joy but the apple be already eat and the
angel arm bar to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster execute his
threat death be inevitable yet again i consider whether my marriage would hasten my fate my
destruction might indeed arrive a few month sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postpone
it influence by his menace he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful mean of revenge he
have vow to be with me on my wedding night yet he do not consider that threat a bind him to peace in
the meantime for as if to show me that he be not yet satiate with blood he have murder clerval
immediately after the enunciation of his threat i resolve therefore that if my immediate union with
my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father happiness my adversarys design against my life
should not retard it a single hour

in this state of mind i write to elizabeth my letter be calm and affectionate i fear my beloved girl
i say little happiness remain for u on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy be centre in you chase
away your idle fear to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavour for contentment i have one
secret elizabeth a dreadful one when reveal to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far
from be surprise at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endure i will confide
this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet
cousin there must be perfect confidence between u but until then i conjure you do not mention or
allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply

in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we return to geneva the sweet girl welcome me
with warm affection yet tear be in her eye a she behold my emaciated frame and feverish cheek i saw
a change in her also she be thinner and have lose much of that heavenly vivacity that have before
charm me but her gentleness and soft look of compassion make her a more fit companion for one blast
and miserable a i be

the tranquillity which i now enjoy do not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought
of what have pass a real insanity possess me sometimes i be furious and burnt with rage sometimes
low and despondent i neither speak nor look at anyone but sit motionless bewilder by the multitude
of misery that overcome me

elizabeth alone have the power to draw me from these fit her gentle voice would soothe me when
transport by passion and inspire me with human feeling when sunk in torpor she weep with me and for
me when reason return she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it be
well for the unfortunate to be resign but for the guilty there be no peace the agony of remorse
poison the luxury there be otherwise sometimes find in indulge the excess of grief

soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth i remain silent

have you then some other attachment

none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight let the day therefore be
fix and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin

my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortune have befall u but let u only cling close to what
remain and transfer our love for those whom we have lose to those who yet live our circle will be
small but bound close by the tie of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have soften
your despair new and dear object of care will be bear to replace those of whom we have be so cruelly
deprive

such be the lesson of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat return nor can you wonder
that omnipotent a the fiend have yet be in his deed of blood i should almost regard him a invincible
and that when he have pronounce the word i shall be with you on your wedding night i should regard
the threatened fate a unavoidable but death be no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth be balance
with it and i therefore with a content and even cheerful countenance agree with my father that if my
cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten day and thus put a i imagine the seal to
my fate

great god if for one instant i have think what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish
adversary i would rather have banish myself for ever from my native country and wander a friendless
outcast over the earth than have consent to this miserable marriage but a if possess of magic power
the monster have blind me to his real intention and when i think that i have prepare only my own
death i hasten that of a far dearer victim

a the period fix for our marriage draw nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt
my heart sink within me but i conceal my feeling by an appearance of hilarity that bring smile and
joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceive the ever watchful and nice eye of elizabeth
she look forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past
misfortune have impress that what now appear certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret

preparation be make for the event congratulatory visit be receive and all wear a smile appearance i
shut up as well a i could in my own heart the anxiety that prey there and enter with seem
earnestness into the plan of my father although they might only serve a the decoration of my tragedy
through my father exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth have be restore to her by the
austrian government a small possession on the shore of como belong to her it be agree that
immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first day of happiness
beside the beautiful lake near which it stand

in the meantime i take every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack
me i carry pistol and a dagger constantly about me and be ever on the watch to prevent artifice and
by these mean gain a great degree of tranquillity indeed a the period approach the threat appear
more a a delusion not to be regard a worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hop for in my
marriage wear a great appearance of certainty a the day fix for it solemnisation draw near and i
hear it continually speak of a an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent

elizabeth seem happy my tranquil demeanour contribute greatly to calm her mind but on the day that
be to fulfil my wish and my destiny she be melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervade her and
perhaps also she think of the dreadful secret which i have promise to reveal to her on the following
day my father be in the meantime overjoy and in the bustle of preparation only recognise in the
melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride

after the ceremony be perform a large party assemble at my father but it be agree that elizabeth and
i should commence our journey by water sleep that night at evian and continue our voyage on the
following day the day be fair the wind favourable all smile on our nuptial embarkation

those be the last moment of my life during which i enjoy the feeling of happiness we pass rapidly
along the sun be hot but we be shelter from it ray by a kind of canopy while we enjoy the beauty of
the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont saleve the pleasant bank of montalegre
and at a distance surmount all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountain that in
vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coast the opposite bank we saw the mighty jura oppose it
dark side to the ambition that would quit it native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to
the invader who should wish to enslave it

i take the hand of elizabeth you be sorrowful my love ah if you know what i have suffer and what i
may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one
day at least permit me to enjoy

be happy my dear victor reply elizabeth there be i hope nothing to distress you and be assure that
if a lively joy be not paint in my face my heart be content something whisper to me not to depend
too much on the prospect that be open before u but i will not listen to such a sinister voice
observe how fast we move along and how the cloud which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above
the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the
innumerable fish that be swim in the clear water where we can distinguish every pebble that lie at
the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appear

thus elizabeth endeavour to divert her thought and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subject
but her temper be fluctuate joy for a few instant shone in her eye but it continually give place to
distraction and reverie

the sun sink low in the heaven we pass the river drance and observe it path through the chasm of the
high and the glen of the low hill the alp here come closer to the lake and we approach the
amphitheatre of mountain which form it eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the wood that
surround it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it be overhung

the wind which have hitherto carry u along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze
the soft air just ruffle the water and cause a pleasant motion among the tree a we approach the
shore from which it waft the most delightful scent of flower and hay the sun sink beneath the
horizon a we land and a i touch the shore i felt those care and fear revive which soon be to clasp
me and cling to me for ever

chapter

it be eight oclock when we land we walk for a short time on the shore enjoy the transitory light and
then retire to the inn and contemplate the lovely scene of water wood and mountain obscure in
darkness yet still display their black outline

the wind which have fall in the south now rise with great violence in the west the moon have reach
her summit in the heaven and be begin to descend the cloud sweep across it swift than the flight of
the vulture and dim her ray while the lake reflect the scene of the busy heaven render still busier
by the restless wave that be begin to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descend

i have be calm during the day but so soon a night obscure the shape of object a thousand fear arose
in my mind i be anxious and watchful while my right hand grasp a pistol which be hide in my bosom
every sound terrify me but i resolve that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the
conflict until my own life or that of my adversary be extinguish

elizabeth observe my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there be something in
my glance which communicate terror to her and tremble she ask what be it that agitate you my dear
victor what be it you fear

oh peace peace my love reply i this night and all will be safe but this night be dreadful very
dreadful

i pass an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflect how fearful the combat which i
momentarily expect would be to my wife and i earnestly entreat her to retire resolve not to join her
until i have obtain some knowledge a to the situation of my enemy

she leave me and i continue some time walk up and down the passage of the house and inspect every
corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discover no trace of him and be begin to
conjecture that some fortunate chance have intervene to prevent the execution of his menace when
suddenly i hear a shrill and dreadful scream it come from the room into which elizabeth have retire
a i hear it the whole truth rush into my mind my arm drop the motion of every muscle and fibre be
suspend i could feel the blood trickling in my vein and tingle in the extremity of my limb this
state last but for an instant the scream be repeat and i rush into the room

great god why do i not then expire why be i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the
pure creature on earth she be there lifeless and inanimate throw across the bed her head hang down
and her pale and distort feature half cover by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her
bloodless arm and relaxed form flung by the murderer on it bridal bier could i behold this and live
ala life be obstinate and cling close where it be most hat for a moment only do i lose recollection
i fell senseless on the ground

when i recover i find myself surround by the people of the inn their countenance express a
breathless terror but the horror of others appear only a a mockery a shadow of the feeling that
oppress me i escape from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately
live so dear so worthy she have be move from the posture in which i have first beheld her and now a
she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have
suppose her asleep i rush towards her and embrace her with ardour but the deadly languor and
coldness of the limb tell me that what i now hold in my arm have cease to be the elizabeth whom i
have love and cherish the murderous mark of the fiend grasp be on her neck and the breath have cease
to issue from her lip

while i still hang over her in the agony of despair i happen to look up the window of the room have
before be darken and i felt a kind of panic on see the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the
chamber the shutter have be throw back and with a sensation of horror not to be describe i saw at
the open window a figure the most hideous and abhor a grin be on the face of the monster he seem to
jeer a with his fiendish finger he point towards the corpse of my wife i rush towards the window and
draw a pistol from my bosom fire but he elude me leap from his station and run with the swiftness of
lightning plunge into the lake

the report of the pistol bring a crowd into the room i point to the spot where he have disappear and
we follow the track with boat net be cast but in vain after pass several hour we return hopeless
most of my companion believe it to have be a form conjure up by my fancy after have land they
proceed to search the country party go in different direction among the wood and vine

i attempt to accompany them and proceed a short distance from the house but my head whirl round my
step be like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film cover my
eye and my skin be parch with the heat of fever in this state i be carry back and place on a bed
hardly conscious of what have happen my eye wander round the room a if to seek something that i have
lose

after an interval i arise and a if by instinct crawl into the room where the corpse of my beloved
lay there be woman weep around i hung over it and join my sad tear to theirs all this time no
distinct idea present itself to my mind but my thought ramble to various subject reflect confusedly
on my misfortune and their cause i be bewilder in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william
the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i know not
that my only remain friend be safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be
writhe under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his foot this idea make me shudder and recall me
to action i start up and resolve to return to geneva with all possible speed

there be no horse to be procure and i must return by the lake but the wind be unfavourable and the
rain fell in torrent however it be hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i
hire men to row and take an oar myself for i have always experience relief from mental torment in
bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endure
render me incapable of any exertion i throw down the oar and lean my head upon my hand give way to
every gloomy idea that arise if i look up i saw scene which be familiar to me in my happier time and
which i have contemplate but the day before in the company of her who be now but a shadow and a
recollection tear stream from my eye the rain have cease for a moment and i saw the fish play in the
water a they have do a few hour before they have then be observe by elizabeth nothing be so painful
to the human mind a a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the cloud might lower but
nothing could appear to me a it have do the day before a fiend have snatch from me every hope of
future happiness no creature have ever be so miserable a i be so frightful an event be single in the
history of man

but why should i dwell upon the incident that follow this last overwhelming event mine have be a
tale of horror i have reach their acme and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know
that one by one my friend be snatch away i be leave desolate my own strength be exhaust and i must
tell in a few word what remain of my hideous narration

i arrive at geneva my father and ernest yet live but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i
see him now excellent and venerable old man his eye wander in vacancy for they have lose their charm
and their delight his elizabeth his more than daughter whom he dot on with all that affection which
a man feel who in the decline of life have few affection cling more earnestly to those that remain
cursed curse be the fiend that bring misery on his grey hair and doom him to waste in wretchedness
he could not live under the horror that be accumulate around him the spring of existence suddenly
give way he be unable to rise from his bed and in a few day he die in my arm

what then become of me i know not i lose sensation and chain and darkness be the only object that
press upon me sometimes indeed i dream that i wander in flowery meadow and pleasant vale with the
friend of my youth but i awoke and find myself in a dungeon melancholy follow but by degree i gain a
clear conception of my misery and situation and be then release from my prison for they have call me
mad and during many month a i understand a solitary cell have be my habitation

liberty however have be a useless gift to me have i not a i awaken to reason at the same time awaken
to revenge a the memory of past misfortune press upon me i begin to reflect on their cause the
monster whom i have create the miserable dmon whom i have send abroad into the world for my
destruction i be possess by a maddening rage when i think of him and desire and ardently pray that i
might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his curse head

nor do my hate long confine itself to useless wish i begin to reflect on the best mean of secure him
and for this purpose about a month after my release i repair to a criminal judge in the town and
tell him that i have an accusation to make that i know the destroyer of my family and that i require
him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer

the magistrate listen to me with attention and kindness be assure sir say he no pain or exertion on
my part shall be spar to discover the villain

i thank you reply i listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it be indeed a tale so
strange that i should fear you would not credit it be there not something in truth which however
wonderful force conviction the story be too connect to be mistake for a dream and i have no motive
for falsehood my manner a i thus address him be impressive but calm i have form in my own heart a
resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quiet my agony and for an interval
reconcile me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision mark the date
with accuracy and never deviate into invective or exclamation

the magistrate appear at first perfectly incredulous but a i continue he become more attentive and
interested i saw him sometimes shudder with horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with
disbelief be paint on his countenance

when i have conclude my narration i say this be the be whom i accuse and for whose seizure and
punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it be your duty a a magistrate and i believe
and hope that your feeling a a man will not revolt from the execution of those function on this
occasion

this address cause a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he have hear my story
with that half kind of belief that be give to a tale of spirit and supernatural event but when he be
call upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity return he however
answer mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you
speak appear to have power which would put all my exertion to defiance who can follow an animal
which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit cave and den where no man would venture to intrude
besides some month have elapse since the commission of his crime and no one can conjecture to what
place he have wander or what region he may now inhabit

i do not doubt that he hover near the spot which i inhabit and if he have indeed take refuge in the
alp he may be hunt like the chamois and destroy a a beast of prey but i perceive your thought you do
not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which be his desert

a i speak rage sparkle in my eye the magistrate be intimidate you be mistake say he i will exert
myself and if it be in my power to seize the monster be assure that he shall suffer punishment
proportionate to his crime but i fear from what you have yourself describe to be his property that
this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure be pursue you should make up your
mind to disappointment

that can not be but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge be of no moment to you yet
while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it be the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage
be unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turn loose upon society still exist you
refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his
destruction

i tremble with excess of agitation a i say this there be a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt
not of that haughty fierceness which the martyr of old be say to have possess but to a genevan
magistrate whose mind be occupy by far other idea than those of devotion and heroism this elevation
of mind have much the appearance of madness he endeavour to soothe me a a nurse do a child and
revert to my tale a the effect of delirium

man i cry how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease you know not what it be you say

i break from the house angry and disturbed and retire to meditate on some other mode of action

chapter

my present situation be one in which all voluntary thought be swallow up and lose i be hurry away by
fury revenge alone endow me with strength and composure it mould my feeling and allow me to be
calculate and calm at period when otherwise delirium or death would have be my portion

my first resolution be to quit geneva for ever my country which when i be happy and beloved be dear
to me now in my adversity become hateful i provide myself with a sum of money together with a few
jewel which have belong to my mother and depart

and now my wandering begin which be to cease but with life i have traverse a vast portion of the
earth and have endure all the hardship which traveller in desert and barbarous country be wont to
meet how i have live i hardly know many time have i stretch my fail limb upon the sandy plain and
prayed for death but revenge keep me alive i dare not die and leave my adversary in be

when i quit geneva my first labour be to gain some clue by which i might trace the step of my
fiendish enemy but my plan be unsettled and i wander many hour round the confines of the town
uncertain what path i should pursue a night approach i find myself at the entrance of the cemetery
where william elizabeth and my father repose i enter it and approach the tomb which mark their graf
everything be silent except the leaf of the tree which be gently agitate by the wind the night be
nearly dark and the scene would have be solemn and affect even to an uninterested observer the
spirit of the depart seem to flit around and to cast a shadow which be felt but not see around the
head of the mourner

the deep grief which this scene have at first excited quickly give way to rage and despair they be
dead and i live their murderer also live and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i
kneel on the grass and kiss the earth and with quiver lip exclaim by the sacred earth on which i
kneel by the shade that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee
o night and the spirit that preside over thee to pursue the dmon who cause this misery until he or i
shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear
revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should
vanish from my eye for ever and i call on you spirit of the dead and on you wander minister of
vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony
let him feel the despair that now torment me

i have begin my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assure me that the shade of my
murdered friend heard and approve my devotion but the fury possess me a i conclude and rage choke my
utterance

i be answer through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it ring on my ear long and
heavily the mountain re echo it and i felt a if all hell surround me with mockery and laughter
surely in that moment i should have be possess by frenzy and have destroy my miserable existence but
that my vow be hear and that i be reserve for vengeance the laughter die away when a well know and
abhor voice apparently close to my ear address me in an audible whisper i be satisfy miserable
wretch you have determine to live and i be satisfied

i dart towards the spot from which the sound proceed but the devil elude my grasp suddenly the broad
disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape a he flee with more than
mortal speed

i pursue him and for many month this have be my task guide by a slight clue i follow the winding of
the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appear and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by
night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i take my passage in the same ship but he
escape i know not how

amidst the wild of tartary and russia although he still evade me i have ever follow in his track
sometimes the peasant scar by this horrid apparition inform me of his path sometimes he himself who
fear that if i lose all trace of him i should despair and die leave some mark to guide me the snow
descend on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first enter on
life to whom care be new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel
cold want and fatigue be the least pain which i be destine to endure i be curse by some devil and
carry about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and direct my step and when
i most murmur would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulty sometimes when
nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast be prepare for me in the desert that
restore and inspirit me the fare be indeed coarse such a the peasant of the country ate but i will
not doubt that it be set there by the spirit that i have invoke to aid me often when all be dry the
heaven cloudless and i be parch by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drop that
revive me and vanish

i follow when i could the course of the river but the dmon generally avoid these a it be here that
the population of the country chiefly collect in other place human being be seldom see and i
generally subsist on the wild animal that cross my path i have money with me and gain the friendship
of the villager by distribute it or i bring with me some food that i have kill which after take a
small part i always present to those who have provide me with fire and utensil for cook

my life a it pass thus be indeed hateful to me and it be during sleep alone that i could taste joy o
bless sleep often when most miserable i sink to repose and my dream lull me even to rapture the
spirit that guard me have provide these moment or rather hour of happiness that i might retain
strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprive of this respite i should have sink under my hardship during
the day i be sustain and inspirit by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friend my wife and my
beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father hear the silver tone of my
elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoy health and youth often when weary by a toilsome march i
persuade myself that i be dream until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the
arm of my dear friends what agonise fondness do i feel for them how do i cling to their dear form a
sometimes they haunt even my waking hour and persuade myself that they still live at such moment
vengeance that burn within me die in my heart and i pursue my path towards the destruction of the
dmon more a a task enjoin by heaven a the mechanical impulse of some power of which i be unconscious
than a the ardent desire of my soul

what his feeling be whom i pursue i can not know sometimes indeed he leave mark in write on the bark
of the tree or cut in stone that guide me and instigate my fury my reign be not yet over these word
be legible in one of these inscription you live and my power be complete follow me i seek the
everlasting ice of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i be
impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refresh
come on my enemy we have yet to wrestle for our life but many hard and miserable hour must you
endure until that period shall arrive

scoff devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death
never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my
elizabeth and my departed friend who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and
horrible pilgrimage

a i still pursue my journey to the northward the snow thicken and the cold increase in a degree
almost too severe to support the peasant be shut up in their hovel and only a few of the most hardy
venture forth to seize the animal whom starvation have force from their hiding place to seek for
prey the river be cover with ice and no fish could be procure and thus i be cut off from my chief
article of maintenance

the triumph of my enemy increase with the difficulty of my labour one inscription that he leave be
in these word prepare your toil only begin wrap yourself in fur and provide food for we shall soon
enter upon a journey where your suffering will satisfy my everlasting hatred

my courage and perseverance be invigorate by these scoff word i resolve not to fail in my purpose
and call on heaven to support me i continue with unabated fervour to traverse immense desert until
the ocean appear at a distance and form the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it be to
the blue season of the south covered with ice it be only to be distinguish from land by it superior
wildness and ruggedness the greek wept for joy when they behold the mediterranean from the hill of
asia and hail with rapture the boundary of their toil i do not weep but i kneel down and with a full
heart thank my guiding spirit for conduct me in safety to the place where i hop notwithstanding my
adversary gibe to meet and grapple with him

some week before this period i have procure a sledge and dog and thus traverse the snow with
inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possess the same advantage but i find that a before
i have daily lose ground in the pursuit i now gain on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean
he be but one day journey in advance and i hop to intercept him before he should reach the beach
with new courage therefore i press on and in two day arrive at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i
inquire of the inhabitant concern the fiend and gain accurate information a gigantic monster they
say have arrive the night before arm with a gun and many pistol put to flight the inhabitant of a
solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he have carry off their store of winter
food and place it in a sledge to draw which he have seize on a numerous drove of trained dog he have
harness them and the same night to the joy of the horror strike villager have pursue his journey
across the sea in a direction that lead to no land and they conjecture that he must speedily be
destroy by the breaking of the ice or freeze by the eternal frost

on hear this information i suffer a temporary access of despair he have escape me and i must
commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ice of the ocean amidst
cold that few of the inhabitant could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny
climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my
rage and vengeance return and like a mighty tide overwhelm every other feeling after a slight repose
during which the spirit of the dead hover round and instigate me to toil and revenge i prepare for
my journey

i exchange my land sledge for one fashion for the inequality of the frozen ocean and purchase a
plentiful stock of provision i depart from land

i can not guess how many day have pass since then but i have endure misery which nothing but the
eternal sentiment of a just retribution burn within my heart could have enable me to support immense
and rugged mountain of ice often bar up my passage and i often hear the thunder of the ground sea
which threaten my destruction but again the frost come and make the path of the sea secure

by the quantity of provision which i have consume i should guess that i have pass three week in this
journey and the continual protraction of hope return back upon the heart often wrung bitter drop of
despondency and grief from my eye despair have indeed almost secure her prey and i should soon have
sink beneath this misery once after the poor animal that convey me have with incredible toil gain
the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue die i view the expanse before
me with anguish when suddenly my eye catch a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strain my sight to
discover what it could be and utter a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguish a sledge and the
distorted proportion of a well know form within oh with what a burn gush do hope revisit my heart
warm tear fill my eye which i hastily wipe away that they might not intercept the view i have of the
dmon but still my sight be dim by the burn drop until give way to the emotion that oppress me i weep
aloud

but this be not the time for delay i disencumber the dog of their dead companion give them a
plentiful portion of food and after an hour rest which be absolutely necessary and yet which be
bitterly irksome to me i continue my route the sledge be still visible nor do i again lose sight of
it except at the moment when for a short time some ice rock conceal it with it intervening crag i
indeed perceptibly gain on it and when after nearly two day journey i behold my enemy at no more
than a mile distant my heart bound within me

but now when i appear almost within grasp of my foe my hope be suddenly extinguish and i lose all
trace of him more utterly than i have ever do before a ground sea be hear the thunder of it progress
a the water roll and swell beneath me become every moment more ominous and terrific i press on but
in vain the wind arise the sea roar and a with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and crack
with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work be soon finish in a few minute a tumultuous sea
roll between me and my enemy and i be leave drift on a scattered piece of ice that be continually
lessening and thus prepare for me a hideous death

in this manner many appalling hour pass several of my dog die and i myself be about to sink under
the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel rid at anchor and hold forth to me hope of
succour and life i have no conception that vessel ever come so far north and be astound at the sight
i quickly destroy part of my sledge to construct oar and by these mean be enable with infinite
fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i have determine if you be go southward
still to trust myself to the mercy of the sea rather than abandon my purpose i hop to induce you to
grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction be northward you take me on
board when my vigour be exhaust and i should soon have sink under my multiplied hardship into a
death which i still dread for my task be unfulfilled

oh when will my guide spirit in conduct me to the dmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i
die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and
satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure
the hardship that i have undergo no i be not so selfish yet when i be dead if he should appear if
the minister of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not live swear that he shall
not triumph over my accumulated woe and survive to add to the list of his dark crime he be eloquent
and persuasive and once his word have even power over my heart but trust him not his soul be as
hellish a his form full of treachery and fiend like malice hear him not call on the name of william
justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart
i will hover near and direct the steel aright

walton in continuation

august

you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with
horror like that which even now curdle mine sometimes seize with sudden agony he could not continue
his tale at others his voice break yet pierce utter with difficulty the word so replete with anguish
his fine and lovely eye be now light up with indignation now subdue to downcast sorrow and quench in
infinite wretchedness sometimes he command his countenance and tone and relate the most horrible
incident with a tranquil voice suppress every mark of agitation then like a volcano burst forth his
face would suddenly change to an expression of the wild rage a he shriek out imprecation on his
persecutor

his tale be connect and tell with an appearance of the simple truth yet i own to you that the letter
of felix and safie which he show me and the apparition of the monster see from our ship bring to me
a great conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseveration however earnest and connect
such a monster have then really existence i can not doubt it yet i be lose in surprise and
admiration sometimes i endeavour to gain from frankenstein the particular of his creature formation
but on this point he be impenetrable

be you mad my friend say he or whither do your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create
for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my misery and do not seek to
increase your own

frankenstein discover that i make note concern his history he ask to see them and then himself
correct and augment them in many place but principally in give the life and spirit to the
conversation he hold with his enemy since you have preserve my narration say he i would not that a
mutilated one should go down to posterity

thus have a week pass away while i have listen to the strange tale that ever imagination form my
thought and every feeling of my soul have be drink up by the interest for my guest which this tale
and his own elevated and gentle manner have create i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so
infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he
can now know will be when he compose his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoy one
comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believe that when in dream he hold converse with
his friend and derives from that communion consolation for his misery or excitement to his vengeance
that they be not the creation of his fancy but the being themselves who visit him from the region of
a remote world this faith give a solemnity to his revery that render them to me almost a imposing
and interesting a truth

our conversation be not always confine to his own history and misfortune on every point of general
literature he display unbounded knowledge and a quick and pierce apprehension his eloquence be
forcible and touch nor can i hear him when he relate a pathetic incident or endeavour to move the
passion of pity or love without tear what a glorious creature must he have be in the day of his
prosperity when he be thus noble and godlike in ruin he seem to feel his own worth and the greatness
of his fall

when younger say he i believe myself destine for some great enterprise my feeling be profound but i
possess a coolness of judgment that fit me for illustrious achievement this sentiment of the worth
of my nature support me when others would have be oppress for i deem it criminal to throw away in
useless grief those talent that might be useful to my fellow creature when i reflect on the work i
have complete no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank
myself with the herd of common projector but this think which support me in the commencement of my
career now serve only to plunge me low in the dust all my speculation and hope be a nothing and like
the archangel who aspire to omnipotence i be chain in an eternal hell my imagination be vivid yet my
power of analysis and application be intense by the union of these quality i conceive the idea and
execute the creation of a man even now i can not recollect without passion my revery while the work
be incomplete i tread heaven in my thought now exult in my power now burn with the idea of their
effect from my infancy i be imbue with high hope and a lofty ambition but how be i sunk oh my friend
if you have know me a i once be you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency
rarely visit my heart a high destiny seem to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise

must i then lose this admirable be i have long for a friend i have seek one who would sympathise
with and love me behold on these desert sea i have find such a one but i fear i have gain him only
to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulse the idea

i thank you walton he say for your kind intention towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak
of new tie and fresh affection think you that any can replace those who be go can any man be to me a
clerval be or any woman another elizabeth even where the affection be not strongly move by any
superior excellence the companion of our childhood always possess a certain power over our mind
which hardly any late friend can obtain they know our infantine disposition which however they may
be afterwards modify be never eradicate and they can judge of our action with more certain
conclusion a to the integrity of our motif a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such
symptom have be show early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however
strongly he may be attach may in spite of himself be contemplate with suspicion but i enjoy friend
dear not only through habit and association but from their own merit and wherever i be the soothing
voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whisper in my ear they be dead
and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i be engage in any
high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creature then could i live to
fulfil it but such be not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the be to whom i give existence then
my lot on earth will be fulfil and i may die

my beloved sister

september

i write to you encompass by peril and ignorant whether i be ever doom to see again dear england and
the dearer friends that inhabit it i be surround by mountain of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuade to be my companion
look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there be something terribly appal in our situation
yet my courage and hope do not desert me yet it be terrible to reflect that the life of all these
men be endanger through me if we be lose my mad scheme be the cause

and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my destruction and you will
anxiously await my return year will pass and you will have visiting of despair and yet be torture by
hope oh my beloved sister the sicken failing of your heart felt expectation be in prospect more
terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely child you may be happy heaven
bless you and make you so

my unfortunate guest regard me with the tender compassion he endeavour to fill me with hope and talk
a if life be a possession which he value he remind me how often the same accident have happen to
other navigator who have attempt this sea and in spite of myself he fill me with cheerful augury
even the sailor feel the power of his eloquence when he speak they no longer despair he rouse their
energy and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountain of ice be mole hill which will
vanish before the resolution of man these feeling be transitory each day of expectation delay fill
them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny cause by this despair

september

a scene have just pass of such uncommon interest that although it be highly probable that these
paper may never reach you yet i can not forbear record it

we be still surround by mountain of ice still in imminent danger of be crush in their conflict the
cold be excessive and many of my unfortunate comrade have already find a grave amidst this scene of
desolation frankenstein have daily decline in health a feverish fire still glimmer in his eye but he
be exhaust and when suddenly rouse to any exertion he speedily sink again into apparent lifelessness

i mention in my last letter the fear i entertain of a mutiny this morning a i sit watch the wan
countenance of my friend his eye half close and his limbs hang listlessly i be rouse by half a dozen
of the sailor who demand admission into the cabin they enter and their leader address me he tell me
that he and his companion have be choose by the other sailor to come in deputation to me to make me
a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we be immure in ice and should probably never
escape but they fear that if as be possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be open i
should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh danger after they might happily
have surmount this they insist therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the
vessel should be free i would instantly direct my course southward

this speech trouble me i have not despair nor have i yet conceive the idea of return if set free yet
could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitate before i answer when
frankenstein who have at first be silent and indeed appear hardly to have force enough to attend now
rouse himself his eye sparkle and his cheek flush with momentary vigour turn towards the men he say

what do you mean what do you demand of your captain be you then so easily turn from your design do
you not call this a glorious expedition and wherefore be it glorious not because the way be smooth
and placid a a southern sea but because it be full of danger and terror because at every new
incident your fortitude be to be call forth and your courage exhibit because danger and death
surround it and these you be to brave and overcome for this be it a glorious for this be it an
honourable undertaking you be hereafter to be hail a the benefactor of your specie your name adore a
belonging to brave men who encounter death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with
the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage
you shrink away and be content to be hand down a men who have not strength enough to endure cold and
peril and so poor soul they be chilly and return to their warm fireside why that require not this
preparation ye need not have come thus far and drag your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to
prove yourselves coward oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purpose and firm a a rock
this ice be not make of such stuff a your heart may be it be mutable and can not withstand you if
you say that it shall not do not return to your family with the stigma of disgrace mark on your brow
return a hero who have fight and conquer and who know not what it be to turn their back on the foe

he speak this with a voice so modulate to the different feeling express in his speech with an eye so
full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men be move they look at one another
and be unable to reply i spoke i tell them to retire and consider of what have be say that i would
not lead them far north if they strenuously desire the contrary but that i hop that with reflection
their courage would return

they retire and i turn towards my friend but he be sink in languor and almost deprive of life

how all this will terminate i know not but i have rather die than return shamefully my purpose
unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by idea of glory and honour can
never willingly continue to endure their present hardship

september

the die be cast i have consent to return if we be not destroy thus be my hope blast by cowardice and
indecision i come back ignorant and disappoint it require more philosophy than i possess to bear
this injustice with patience

september

it be past i be return to england i have lose my hope of utility and glory i have lose my friend but
i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstance to you my dear sister and while i be waft
towards england and towards you i will not despond

september the ice begin to move and roaring like thunder be hear at a distance a the island split
and crack in every direction we be in the most imminent peril but a we could only remain passive my
chief attention be occupy by my unfortunate guest whose illness increase in such a degree that he be
entirely confine to his bed the ice crack behind u and be drive with force towards the north a
breeze sprang from the west and on the the passage towards the south become perfectly free when the
sailor saw this and that their return to their native country be apparently assure a shout of
tumultuous joy break from them loud and long continued frankenstein who be doze awoke and ask the
cause of the tumult they shout i say because they will soon return to england

do you then really return

ala yes i can not withstand their demand i can not lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return

do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine be assign to me by heaven and
i dare not i be weak but surely the spirit who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient
strength say this he endeavour to spring from the bed but the exertion be too great for him he fell
back and faint

it be long before he be restore and i often think that life be entirely extinct at length he open
his eye he breathe with difficulty and be unable to speak the surgeon give him a composing draught
and order u to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he tell me that my friend have certainly not
many hour to live

his sentence be pronounce and i could only grieve and be patient i sit by his bed watch him his eye
be closed and i think he sleep but presently he call to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come
near say ala the strength i rely on be go i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and
persecutor may still be in be think not walton that in the last moment of my existence i feel that
burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once express but i feel myself justify in desire the
death of my adversary during these last day i have be occupy in examine my past conduct nor do i
find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i create a rational creature and be bind towards
him to assure as far a be in my power his happiness and well be this be my duty but there be another
still paramount to that my duty towards the being of my own specie have great claim to my attention
because they include a great proportion of happiness or misery urge by this view i refuse and i do
right in refuse to create a companion for the first creature he show unparalleled malignity and
selfishness in evil he destroy my friend he devote to destruction being who possess exquisite
sensation happiness and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable
himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction be mine but
i have fail when actuate by selfish and vicious motif i ask you to undertake my unfinished work and
i renew this request now when i be only induce by reason and virtue

yet i can not ask you to renounce your country and friend to fulfil this task and now that you be
return to england you will have little chance of meet with him but the consideration of these point
and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duty i leave to you my judgment and idea be
already disturb by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may
still be mislead by passion

that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respect this hour when i
momentarily expect my release be the only happy one which i have enjoy for several year the form of
the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arm farewell walton seek happiness in
tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguish
yourself in science and discovery yet why do i say this i have myself be blast in these hope yet
another may succeed

his voice become fainter a he speak and at length exhaust by his effort he sink into silence about
half an hour afterwards he attempt again to speak but be unable he press my hand feebly and his eye
close for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile pass away from his lip

margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say
that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be
inadequate and feeble my tear flow my mind be overshadow by a cloud of disappointment but i journey
towards england and i may there find consolation

i be interrupt what do these sound portend it be midnight the breeze blow fairly and the watch on
deck scarcely stir again there be a sound a of a human voice but hoarser it come from the cabin
where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister

great god what a scene have just take place i be yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know
whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have record would be incomplete
without this final and wonderful catastrophe

i enter the cabin where lay the remains of my ill fat and admirable friend over him hang a form
which i can not find word to describe gigantic in stature yet uncouth and distort in it proportion a
he hang over the coffin his face be conceal by long lock of ragged hair but one vast hand be extend
in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he hear the sound of my approach he cease
to utter exclamation of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never do i behold a vision so
horrible a his face of such loathsome yet appal hideousness i shut my eye involuntarily and
endeavour to recollect what be my duty with regard to this destroyer i call on him to stay

he pause look on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seem
to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seem instigate by the wild rage of some
uncontrollable passion

that be also my victim he exclaim in his murder my crime be consummate the miserable series of my be
be wind to it close oh frankenstein generous and self devote be what do it avail that i now ask thee
to pardon me i who irretrievably destroy thee by destroy all thou lovedst ala he be cold he can not
answer me

his voice seem suffocated and my first impulse which have suggest to me the duty of obey the die
request of my friend in destroy his enemy be now suspend by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i
approach this tremendous be i dare not again raise my eye to his face there be something so scaring
and unearthly in his ugliness i attempt to speak but the word die away on my lip the monster
continue to utter wild and incoherent self reproach at length i gather resolution to address him in
a pause of the tempest of his passion

your repentance i say be now superfluous if you have listen to the voice of conscience and heed the
sting of remorse before you have urge your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would
yet have live

and do you dream say the dmon do you think that i be then dead to agony and remorse he he continue
point to the corpse he suffer not in the consummation of the deed oh not the ten thousandth portion
of the anguish that be mine during the linger detail of it execution a frightful selfishness hurry
me on while my heart be poison with remorse think you that the groan of clerval be music to my ear
my heart be fashion to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrench by misery to vice and
hatred it do not endure the violence of the change without torture such a you can not even imagine

after the murder of clerval i return to switzerland heart broken and overcome i pity frankenstein my
pity amount to horror i abhor myself but when i discover that he the author at once of my existence
and of it unspeakable torment dare to hope for happiness that while he accumulate wretchedness and
despair upon me he seek his own enjoyment in feeling and passion from the indulgence of which i be
for ever bar then impotent envy and bitter indignation fill me with an insatiable thirst for
vengeance i recollect my threat and resolve that it should be accomplish i know that i be prepare
for myself a deadly torture but i be the slave not the master of an impulse which i detest yet could
not disobey yet when she die nay then i be not miserable i have cast off all feeling subdue all
anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth become my good urge thus far i have no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i have willingly choose the completion of my
demoniacal design become an insatiable passion and now it be end there be my last victim

i be at first touch by the expression of his misery yet when i call to mind what frankenstein have
say of his power of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eye on the lifeless form of my
friend indignation be rekindle within me wretch i say it be well that you come here to whine over
the desolation that you have make you throw a torch into a pile of building and when they be consume
you sit among the ruin and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still live still
would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it be not pity that
you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity be withdraw from your power

oh it be not thus not thus interrupt the be yet such must be the impression convey to you by what
appear to be the purport of my action yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i
ever find when i first seek it it be the love of virtue the feeling of happiness and affection with
which my whole be overflow that i wish to be participate but now that virtue have become to me a
shadow and that happiness and affection be turn into bitter and loathe despair in what should i seek
for sympathy i be content to suffer alone while my suffering shall endure when i die i be well
satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy be soothe with dream of
virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hop to meet with being who pardon my outward form
would love me for the excellent quality which i be capable of unfold i be nourish with high thought
of honour and devotion but now crime have degrade me beneath the mean animal no guilt no mischief no
malignity no misery can be find comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sin
i can not believe that i be the same creature whose thought be once fill with sublime and
transcendent vision of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it be even so the fallen angel
become a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man have friend and associate in his
desolation i be alone

you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crime and his misfortune but in
the detail which he give you of them he could not sum up the hour and month of misery which i endure
waste in impotent passion for while i destroy his hope i do not satisfy my own desire they be for
ever ardent and crave still i desire love and fellowship and i be still spurn be there no injustice
in this be i to be think the only criminal when all humankind sin against me why do you not hate
felix who drive his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who seek
to destroy the saviour of his child nay these be virtuous and immaculate being i the miserable and
the abandon be an abortion to be spurn at and kick and trample on even now my blood boil at the
recollection of this injustice

but it be true that i be a wretch i have murder the lovely and the helpless i have strangle the
innocent a they sleep and grasp to death his throat who never injure me or any other living thing i
have devote my creator the select specimen of all that be worthy of love and admiration among men to
misery i have pursue him even to that irremediable ruin there he lie white and cold in death you
hate me but your abhorrence can not equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hand which
execute the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it be conceive and long for the
moment when these hand will meet my eye when that imagination will haunt my thought no more

fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work be nearly complete neither yours
nor any man death be need to consummate the series of my be and accomplish that which must be do but
it require my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your
vessel on the ice raft which bring me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the
globe i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ash this miserable frame that it remains may
afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another a i have be i
shall die i shall no longer feel the agony which now consume me or be the prey of feeling
unsatisfied yet unquenched he be dead who call me into be and when i shall be no more the very
remembrance of u both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or star or feel the wind
play on my cheek light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my
happiness some year ago when the image which this world afford first open upon me when i felt the
cheer warmth of summer and hear the rustling of the leaf and the warbling of the bird and these be
all to me i should have weep to die now it be my only consolation pollute by crime and tear by the
bitter remorse where can i find rest but in death

farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eye will ever behold farewell
frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherish a desire of revenge against me it would be well
satiate in my life than in my destruction but it be not so thou didst seek my extinction that i
might not cause great wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not cease to
think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance great than that which i feel blast a
thou wert my agony be still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to
rankle in my wound until death shall close them for ever

but soon he cry with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt
soon these burn misery will be extinct i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the
agony of the torturing flame the light of that conflagration will fade away my ash will be sweep
into the sea by the wind my spirit will sleep in peace or if it think it will not surely think thus
farewell

he spring from the cabin window a he say this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel he be
soon borne away by the wave and lose in darkness and distance
